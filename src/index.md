# Party Roles

This is not official by any means, but here are common roles party members can fill. When thinking of the character you want to build, try to make sure you can adequately fill one battle role and one exploration role. For instance, a Rogue is a good striker and infiltrator, easily falling into those two categories. Fighter abilities lean much more toward combat, but Fighters have some flexibility with their builds, allowing you to allocate stats and pick feats to fill an exploration role.

## Battle Roles

These are roles your character can play in combat.

### Blaster

A Blaster is able to attack an area of multiple opponents (known as area of effect damage, or AOE). This is almost exclusively a role filled by spellcasters like Clerics, Sorcerers, and Wizards, although a few Paladin and Barbarian subclasses dabble in this.

Blasters excel at wiping out groups of weaker opponents and can turn some encounters into a cakewalk. They typically use limited resources (like spell slots) and have to make a tactical choice as to when and where to use their blasting spells.

A good litmus test for this is seeing who has access to the Fireball spell. The list is:

* Wizard (any)
* Sorcerer (any)
* Cleric &ndash; Light Domain
* Warlock &ndash; The Fiend and the Genie
* Artificer &ndash; Artillerist (although they get it much later than pure spellcasters)

Other classes might have other blasting spells, and some magic items can grant access to Fireball, but the above classes are generally great Blasters.

Other good blasting spells include:

* **Call Lightning** (__3rd level__) &ndash; Notably available to Druids and Tempest Clerics, but not Sorcerers and Wizards.
* **Fireball** (__3rd level__) &ndash; The quintessential blasting spell that all others are compared to. Available to Sorcerers, Wizards, and some Artificers, Clerics, and Warlocks.
* **Hunger of Hadar** (__3rd level__) &ndash; Delightfully spooky and available only to Warlocks.
* **Ice Knife** (__1st level__) &ndash; A good 1st-level option until you're able to get a more powerful 3rd-level spell. Available to Druids, Sorcerers, and Wizards.
* **Ice Storm** (__4th level__) &ndash; A decent blast spell that also creates difficult terrain for your enemies. Available to Druids, Sorcerers, Wizards, and a few other subclasses.
* **Lightning Bolt** (__3rd level__) &ndash; Equivalent damage to Fireball, but fires in a straight line.
* **Meteor Swarm** (__9th level__) &ndash; The ultimate blaster spell? Available to Sorcerers and Wizards.
* **Shatter** (__2nd level__) &ndash; A low level but nonetheless effective thunder spell available to many spellcasters.
* **Spirit Guardians** (__3rd level__) &ndash; A Cleric staple that makes them a threat on the front lines. Notably, unlike most blasting spells, friendly fire is not possible with Spirit Guardians.
* **Synaptic Static** (__5th level__) &ndash; A blast of psychic energy with an additional disabling effect. Available to Bards, Sorcerers, Warlocks, and Wizards.
* **Thunder Step** (__3rd level__) &ndash; A thunder-blasting spell with a built-in teleport to escape a group of enemies. Available to Sorcerers, Warlocks, and Wizards.
* **Thunderwave** (__1st level__) &ndash; An early-level blasting spell available to most spellcasters.

### Controller

Keeps enemies from engaging the party or fighting at full strength. Usually a function of spellcasters, but some martial characters can do this too. This usually involves taking enemies out of the fight, but can happen in other ways.

Most pure spellcasting classes (especially Druid, Wizard, and Warlock) have control spells and can support a Controller build. Spellcasters with control spells can shut down an entire area of enemies, effectively removing them from battle until you're ready to deal with them. Some half-casters, such as an Oath of Redemption Paladin, have access to these spells too. Monks have access to Stunning Strike and can make terribly effective Controllers, albeit for one target at a time.

Don't underestimate the power of grapples either. A strong character with a good Athletics score can grapple one or more opponents, achieving the same effect as Hold Person/Creature. Once grappled, a creature can be shoved onto the ground. Standing takes half of a creature's movement, and a creature's movement becomes 0 when grappled, so creatures that are both prone and grappled are unable to get up without a successful athletics check to escape the grapple.

Area control is another aspect of this, which involves locking down parts of the battle area rather than individual opponents. Spells like Create Bonfire, Spike Growth, and Moonbeam can make parts of a map hazardous for opponents, giving them a good reason to avoid it. Melee fighters with the Sentinel feat can stop opponents from moving past them, providing a sort of area control as well.

Good control spells include:

* **Enemies Abound** (__3rd level__) &ndash; Turn the biggest enemy against its own party.
* **Entangle** (__1st level__) &ndash; A great low-level option available to Druids and Rangers (with optional spells enabled).
* **Forcecage** (__7th level__) &ndash; A resilient and reliable control spell for a single target, even against powerful foes. Available to Bards, Sorcerers, and Wizards.
* **Hold Monster** (__5th level__) &ndash; Basically, Hold Person, but it works on non-humanoid creatures. Pretty much the same thing the Monk gets with a stunning strike. Available to many spellcasters.
* **Hold Person** (__2nd level__) &ndash; Paralyzes a single humanoid target (but can be upcast for additional targets). This does pretty much the same thing as a Monk's stunning strike. Available to most spellcasters.
* **Hypnotic Pattern** (__3rd level__) &ndash; Can completely decimate an enemy party. Notably does not allow a subsequent saving throw when the enemy's next turn comes up, so if an enemy fails the first saving throw, they're finished. Available to Bards, Sorcerers, Warlocks, Wizards, and a few subclasses.
* **Mass Suggestion** (__6th level__) &ndash; Suggestion for up to 12 targets.
* **Plant Growth** (__3rd level__) &ndash; Creates super-difficult terrain with a 100-foot radius with no concentration or time limit, often limiting enemies to moving only one 5-foot square per turn. Available to Bards, Druids, Rangers, and a few other subclasses.
* **Stinking Cloud** (__3rd level__) &ndash; Works on a Constitution save, which tends to be higher than other saves on enemies, but disables everything in a 20-foot radius that fails the save. Also a great set-up for fart jokes. Available to Bards, Sorcerers, Wizards, and some Druids and Warlocks.
* **Suggestion** (__2nd level__) &ndash; Great for distracting or getting rid of a single opponent. Available to Bards, Sorcerers, Warlocks, Wizards, and Knowledge Clerics.
* **Wall spells** (__Fire, Force, Ice, Light, Stone, Thorns, Water, Wind__) &ndash; Too many to list individually, but these can be great for separating one tough encounter into two smaller ones, or blocking off enemies to give your party time to do something or escape. Many spellcasters will get at least one wall spell.
* **Web** (__2nd level__) &ndash; Great for setting traps for opponents. Available to Artificers, Sorcerers, Wizards, and some Druids.

### Striker

These are your main damage-dealers, specializing in attacking a single target. Can be achieved in a variety of ways. Many classes excel in this role, and every class has at least one subclass that excels in dealing damage. There are two ways to build this: sustained and nova damage.

Sustained damage characters will continue to do good damage with any number of fights, with either little reliance on limited resources or quick replenishment (on short rest). They can be relied on to do good damage in just about any situation. Fighters, Warlocks, Barbarians, Monks, and Rogues are all good at this.

Nova damage characters have much higher damage potential when it's needed, but limited resources, so they need to ration it out. This allows them to make tactical choices about which enemies to take down quickly. Paladins, Sorcerers, and Wizards are the most clear-cut examples of nova damage characters, but any character that can use a limited resource to significantly boost their damage falls into this category. For example, Berserker Barbarians have to manage levels of exhaustion to gain a large bonus to their attack output and have some nova damage potential based on calculated risk.

### Support

Help teammates in battle in various ways. Can involve healing spells, buffs, or other ways of making teammates more effective.

Clerics, Bards, and Druids are the most archetypal Support characters, but other classes can fill this role in odd ways. Paladins often have auras that can buff nearby teammates, and the Mastermind Rogue and Totem Barbarian have mechanics to grant allies advantage on attack rolls. Warlocks and Sorcerers also have subclasses that grant support abilities. Some races, such as Aasimar and Bugbear, also have support features. The Healer feat also allows a character to heal an ally using a Healer's Kit, which has broad uses, but is really useful to the Thief Rogue (who can use an item as a bonus action), allowing them to be combat medics in a pinch.

Healing is important, but not as important as it is in many video games. It's generally very difficult (and inadvisable) to keep up with healing allies in the middle of a fight. Healing is for quick saves when a character is near death (or has just been knocked out). It's usually a better idea to get the party to do more damage and end fights quickly than to keep everyone healed through the fight. In that sense, buffs can be just as important as healing for a support character.

Buffs include spells and abilities that increase skills or saving throws, allow allies to take extra actions, or grant advantage on attack rolls. Many spellcasters have buff options, but martial characters can do things like shove an opponent prone to grant advantage to allies. Paladins also have auras, which grant benefits to any ally within range.

### Tank

Take the hits so teammates don't have to. Usually involves a high Constitution score, and good tanks have methods of increasing their threat.

Barbarians are excellent tanks, with Paladins and Fighters following closely behind, although many other classes can be built to take hits. Circle of the Moon Druids can wildshape into tanky animals, and Rangers and Monks can be built defensively. The Armorer Artificer can also be a great tank.

Beware the Tank Fallacy. You can build a highly defensive character that can withstand any damage, but there's nothing to stop an enemy from running right past you and attacking the wizard behind you. If a smart opponent sees someone in heavy armor and a wizard in robes behind them, they will almost certainly try for the wizard.

To be an effective tank, you need some way of getting enemies to focus on you. This can be accomplished, perhaps counterintuitively, by focusing on doing lots of damage to make yourself a greater threat to the enemy force. Some subclasses, such as the Ancestral Guardian Barbarian, Cavalier Fighter, and Armorer Artificer, have mechanics for incentivizing opponents to target them instead of their teammates.

## Exploration Roles

These roles cover things your party usually has to do out of combat.

### Face

Good in social encounters, particularly with convincing someone to do or believe something. Usually requires a high Charisma stat and/or good scores in Persuasion, Deception, and Intimidation.

Bards are known for being great Faces, but any character with a high Charisma score can achieve this. Paladins, Sorcerers, and Warlocks all need Charisma for class features, but Rogues, Fighters, and even Barbarians can all have high Charisma scores too, if built that way. Some subclasses, such as the Rune Knight Fighter, grant advantage on skill checks for social encounters, and they can be effective faces too. Other subclasses, like the Fey Wanderer or Samurai, grant bonuses to social skills based on other stats.

### Infiltration

Stealth, breaking & entering, general trickery. (Disarming traps falls here too.) Usually requires a high Dexterity stat and proficiency with Thieves' Tools. A decent Investigation skill can be really helpful too.

There's one class that's all about this: Rogues. Every Rogue is good at this. Many other classes have subclasses with some Rogue-ish qualities, like the Trickery Cleric and Shadow Monk, but you can also build most characters to have these proficiencies, if desired. Some character backgrounds, such as Criminal, will grant proficiency in Thieves' Tools.

Armorer Artificers can also choose the Infiltrator model armor, which greatly increases their stealth capabilities. They can craft items which increase other infiltration skills, like Gloves of Thievery, and they get some utility magic options which can help with this too.

There are some spells that can grant these abilities too, such as Knock to open locks and Pass Without Trace to make the party good at sneaking, so some spellcasters can fill this role, assuming they can spare the spell slots.

### Knowledge
<p>Knowing stuff about the things we encounter. In D&D, having a successful roll in a knowledge skill allows you to ask the DM for hints. Usually requires a good Intelligence stat, but can also be achieved with proficiency or expertise in knowledge skills.</p>
<p>Classes that rely on intelligence are natural fits here. Wizards and Artificers top the list, but some other subclasses, like the Arcane Archer Fighter or Arcane Trickster Rogue, also need it. Other classes don't explicitly need a high intelligence, but can still work well as Knowledge types, such as the Knowledge Cleric or some Bards.</p>
<p>It's also very possible to be good in just one knowledge skill, even if you're not broadly good at all of them. Rangers, for instance, often pick Nature as a skill proficiency, even though they may not know much about royal lineages or magic effects.</p>

### Scout

Stealth, perception, tracking skills. Usually involves a high Wisdom stat and/or Perception skill. Survival and Stealth skills help too.

One class is the undisputed king of this, and that is Ranger. Other classes can be built to fill this role, provided they have good scores in Stealth and Perception. (Monks and Rogues can make very decent Scouts.) Some magical spells, like Arcane Eye or Beast Sense, can also be used to scout.

Scouting is something that doesn't necessarily happen in every D&D game, but it's as useful as you and your DM make it. If you have scouting skills or want to be a scout, make sure your DM knows this and allows you opportunities to shine.

### Utility

Utility is, essentially, things you can do outside of combat, and Utility characters are good at doing a wide variety of things. This can mean having a lot of skill proficiencies, but having a wide variety of useful spells can also give some good utility. Tool proficiencies may also come into play, but not as often.

For magical utility, Wizards are the top pick because they get access to more spells than anyone, allowing them to take niche spells that other classes couldn't afford a spot for. Artificers get a lot of great utility spells as well, despite being half-casters, and they pick up a lot of tool proficiencies as well. Knowledge Clerics can also use their Channel Divinity to give themselves temporary proficiency with any skill or tool.

Rogues and Bards get more skill proficiencies than any other class, making them excellent Utility characters. Bards in particular get half-proficiency for every skill, gaining at least a small bonus for every skill.

There are several feats that grant more skills:

* Skilled
* Skill Master
* Prodigy (human or half-human only)

Characters can also multiclass and take a few levels of Bard or Rogue to gain some skill proficiencies, or Wizard to gain some low-level utility spells.

Surprisingly, really strong characters can have a lot of utility, even without a lot of proficiencies. A portable ram can open doors with strength, a hammer and pitons (along with a good Athletics score) can find a way up a sheer cliff for the entire party, and a crowbar can apply advantage in all kinds of situations.

There are many useful utility spells—too many to list and talk about—but here are some of the notable ones:

* **Cantrips** &ndash; Acid Splash, Druidcraft, Light, Mage Hand, Mending, Message, Mold Earth, Prestidigitation, Produce Flame, Shape Water, Thaumaturgy
* **1st Level** &ndash; Alarm, Detect Magic, Feather Fall, Floating Disk
* **2nd Level** &ndash; Alter Self, Darkvision, Knock, Pass Without Trace, Rope Trick
* **3rd Level** &ndash; Dispel Magic, Fly, Sending, Tiny Hut, Tongues, Water Breathing
* **4th Level** &ndash; Arcane Eye, Control Water, Fabricate, Stone Shape
* **5th Level** &ndash; Awaken, Dream, Passwall, Skill Empowerment, Telekinesis
* **6th Level** &ndash; Arcane Gate, Contingency, Find the Path
* **7th Level** &ndash; Magnificent Mansion, Plane Shift, Teleport
* **8th Level** &ndash; Telepathy
* **9th Level** &ndash; Astral Projection, Time Stop, Wish

## Party Composition

Not every party needs every role filled, but every party will eventually face all of these challenges. Lean into your party's strengths. If the party lacks heavy frontline support but is really sneaky (like Team Fleet Fox), lean into stealth tactics rather than launching a frontal assault.

Things to keep in mind:

* **Think about the front line.** Parties can absolutely survive without a tank or defender, but they still need a defined front line in battle. If nobody's on the front line, everyone's on the front line.
* **Make sure you can keep people alive.** Adventuring days can include numerous battles, sometimes 6-8. You'll get short rests, but may only get one long rest in that time. Using your hit dice on short rests will only get you so far. Having a healer is nice, but you can get creative with that—it can easily be someone with the Healer feat and a healer's kit, or a Way of Mercy Monk. Yes, you can just buy a lot of potions, but it helps to have a character with some innate healing ability.
* **Make sure you can kill your enemies.** No matter how stealthy or diplomatic you are, you will eventually get into a fight. Make sure you have some good ways of dealing damage. This usually means having at least one (preferably several) characters in the striker or blaster roles.
* **Play to your strengths.** If you don't have a utility caster, but have a bunch of martial characters, find ways to solve problems with your strength. Carry pitons and a bunch of ropes, or a portable ram. If you have a frontliner who's not really a tank, take a spell to help them out if they get in trouble. Find alternate ways to solve problems using what your party is good at.
* **Play what you want.** Don't let party composition keep you from playing a character you want to play. Enjoying your character is much more important than the mechanics of the game.
