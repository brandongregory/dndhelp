Kobold Think Tank is a resource for tabletop RPGs, especially Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e. We aim to provide thorough but easy-to-understand articles on characters, concepts, and general play.

All articles are living documents and will be updated as things change or our understanding of the game changes.
