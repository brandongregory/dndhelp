Kobold Think Tank is a resource for tabletop RPGs, especially Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e. We aim to provide thorough but easy to understand articles on characters, concepts, and general play.

All articles are living documents and will be updated as things change, or as our understanding of the game changes.
