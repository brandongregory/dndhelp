# Social Contracts

## Make sure your players feel safe

_Anything trauma-related is off-limits. This includes any sexual violence, depictions of domestic abuse, overly graphic depictions of violence or cruelty, anti-gay or anti-trans sentiments, and any racial stereotypes with obvious parallels to our real world. This is a safe space and people shouldn’t have to talk about their trauma to not be triggered. If you have trauma and there are specific non-obvious triggers we should avoid, feel free to either tell the group or just the DM in private._

I once watched a session zero from a prominent DM. The DM told the players that certain topics would be off limits based on what the players were comfortable with. I initially thought that was really cool. But then the DM asked the table what topics were off limits, and this poor woman had to raise her hand and ask the table to not talk about sexual assault. While it's cool that she was able to openly talk about that, not everyone will be comfortable talking about triggers. If you have a gay or trans person at your table who doesn't want a lot of people to know, they may not be comfortable raising their hands and saying so—and when players don't feel safe, roleplaying doesn't really happen.

If you're 100% sure you know what your table is comfortable with, feel free to craft this part on your own, but the fact is most people aren't aware of all of their friends' trauma. The above statement covers a pretty broad range and goes a long way toward making everyone feel comfortable. You can always add potentially triggering things into your game, but it's a lot harder to undo the damage that they can do if lines have already been crossed.

## Players should work together

_We’re all a team. Disagreements are natural and do pop up, but if your character disagrees so much that it regularly comes to blows with other player characters, it’s time to roll a new character. Expressly off-limits things include casting charm on party members, stealing from party members, intentionally putting party members in dangerous situations without their consent, and otherwise being a dick. If your behavior would require a statement like, “It’s just a joke,” don’t do it._

_Everyone gets turns in the spotlight. Be looking for times to make your fellow players the hero of the moment. Don’t rush to open the lock if you’re a monk and there’s a rogue in the party. Your moment will come._

There are two serious player afflictions that can plague tables: **My Guy Syndrome** and **Main Character Syndrome**. Either one of these can completely derail a campaign and make the game miserable for everyone.

**My Guy Syndrome** leads players to hurt other characters, make other players feel uncomfortable, or otherwise be dicks, and then justify it by saying, "It's what my guy would do!" If other players (or the DM) are regularly unhappy with what your character is doing, roleplaying is not an excuse. If you want a game where you can do whatever you want and nobody else has a say, go play an open world video game. Dungeons and Dragons and other tabletop RPGs requires other people to play, and if a player is driving away other players or the DM, they shouldn't play.

Players with **Main Character Syndrome** see themselves as the main character of the campaign and will try to center themselves in every scene. DnD is a game in which every character will be good at something, but no character will be good at everything. This doesn't matter to characters with Main Character Syndrome; they will try to jump in and do everything, even when other characters are much more suited to the task. They will try to make their characters' backstories the main focus of the story. If a player wants the entire story to be about them, they should stop roleplaying and write a novel.

Some players may just not realize that they're doing these things, or that these things are bad for the table, so making a statement about these up-front can prevent some awkward and sometimes explosive confrontations later in the campaign. If expectations are set before the campaign begins, it's far easier to point back at the rules than it is to try to explain to a player why they need to chill out.

## Players should keep the game moving forward

_Keep the game moving. Think about what you’re going to do on your next turn. If you cast a spell or use an ability, have the description ready to read and know how to use it._

_Don’t derail the game. If there’s a clear direction the party should be heading and your character chooses, against the party’s wishes, to head the opposite direction, that’s a problem. If you’re acting out a gag, make sure the other characters are all enjoying it and it’s not detracting from the session. Don’t take random harmful actions simply because you think they're funny, like attacking a city guard without provocation. Hijinks are OK, but they should involve other players, they should not jeopardize the plot at large, and they should end before other players get annoyed._

New players will probably take a few sessions to really learn how to play, and that's totally understandable; but there's also an expectation that players will take the time to learn how their characters work, and think about the game as they're playing it. If a player completely grinds the game to a halt each time their turn comes around, they might need to spend some time thinking about mechanics. I totally get that not every player wants to sit down and read the entire rulebook, but there are a variety of character builds possible with varying degrees of complexity. If a player doesn't want to learn complex rules, a Fighter will be a much better choice than a Wizard.

If a player is intentionally derailing a game, that's disrespectful of everyone else at the table—including the DM. This can happen with players doing intentionally asinine stuff, but it can also happen if the players and the DM feel like they're pitted against each other. If players are intentionally avoiding plot hooks in some attempt to thwart the DM, there's not much future for the campaign unless everyone learns to work together. 

**Respect the DM.** We will have some conversations on rules, but the DM has final say regardless of what the rules say. The DM puts time into preparing sessions and will often provide plot hooks to get you to the next significant content. React to those plot hooks for the best experience for everyone. Remember: the DM is there to have fun too.

**If you’re not having fun, speak up.** We want everyone to have fun.
