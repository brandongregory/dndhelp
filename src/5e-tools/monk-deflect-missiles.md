Input your Monk level and Dexterity modified below to see the average and minimum damage you can deflect. Average is just that: roughly a 50% chance of doing this or better. Minimum means youâ€™re guaranteed at least this much.

<table>

        <td>Monk Level</td>
        <td><input type="number" min="3" max="20" placeholder="3-20" id="deflect-missiles--monk-level"></td>
    </tr>
