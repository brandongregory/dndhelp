# Mental Stats Compared in 5e

Dungeons and Dragons 5e gives you 3 mental stats: Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Picking which one of these you want to invest in can have a lot of impact on your character, not only in the skills they’re good at, but also from a roleplaying perspective.

## <a name="Intelligence"></a>Intelligence

Intelligence is the classic “book smarts.” Anyone can be educated, but an intelligent character will remember things years or decades later and be able to logically put things together much more efficiently than other characters. It’s a required stat for scholars, but tacticians and military commanders, as well as investigator types, also have high intelligence.

Intelligence skills include Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion. Most of these are general knowledge skills and good rolls will allow you to ask the DM what your character knows about certain things in the world—for instance, hearing a nobleman’s name might mean little to most characters, but a good History roll would tell you that this nobleman has been publicly challenging the king and buffing up his military force lately. Investigation is the odd one of the bunch, and is mostly used for looking for clues and searching for things.

A high-intelligence character is accustomed to focusing on studies and investigations without getting distracted. They’re the kind of people you might have to pull away from books when a high stakes question needs an answer. They like to plan and usually have a back-up plan in case things fail. They’re also typically well-read and can easily relate one subject to another they’ve read about. Intelligent characters also hate being understimulated and will seek out interesting or challenging things to learn—although they may get frustrated with research tasks if they consider the subject matter dull or banal.

Low-intelligence characters may be easily bored or distracted from mental tasks (even ones they’re interested in), and may be slow to put together clues, even if the player is good at those things. They’re not necessarily poorly educated, but may have trouble recalling things they remember from school. They will often prefer physical or improvisational solutions to problems rather than extensive planning.

Classes likely to have a high intelligence include:

* Artificer (any)
* Cleric – Knowledge domain
* Fighter – Arcane Archer, Battlemaster, Eldritch Knight, or Psi Knight
* Rogue – Arcane Trickster, Inquisitive, or Soul Knife
* Wizard (any)

High-intelligence characters in pop culture include:

* Bulma from Dragon Ball Z
* Loki from the Marvel movies
* Princess Bubblegum from Adventure Time
* Solas from Dragon Age
* Tali’Zorah from Mass Effect
* Tony Stark/Iron Man from the Marvel movies
* Gandalf from Lord of the Rings

## <a name="Wisdom"></a>Wisdom

Wisdom is more of a “street smarts,” compared to Intelligence, and most often measures intuition and awareness. This includes general awareness of surroundings, awareness of how other people are acting and reacting, awareness of a patient’s health, and self-awareness. Characters that spend a lot of time in self reflection are usually high-wisdom characters, but rugged outdoors types and streetwise rogues or ruffians often have a high wisdom stat as well.

Wisdom stats include Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival. Insight is a skill for reading others and gauging their intentions, and Animal Handling is like people skills for animals. Perception and Survival are commonly thought of as scouting skills. Medicine is a bit of an odd fit, but it’s still technically a Wisdom skill.

A high-wisdom character is going to be aware of their surroundings, being quick to recognize danger or subtle changes in a crowd. They’re often quick-thinking, preferring to use their well-developed intuition to improvise their way through things rather than rely on extensive planning. They’re very self-aware—if you ask them what their weaknesses are, they’re going to know exactly what those weaknesses are, and they’ll be working to fix them. They’re also typically fond of parables and stories that tell life lessons, sometimes choosing to tell a story rather than answer a question.

Low-wisdom characters can manifest in a few ways. They can lack awareness, frequently getting lost in their thoughts or distracted by small things in focus while ignoring things happening around them. It can also manifest as a lack of self awareness, or immaturity. Imagine a man so convinced that he has no weaknesses that he finds ways to justify his mistakes or blame them on others.

Classes likely to have a high wisdom stat include:

* Cleric (any)
* Druid (any)
* Monk (any)
* Ranger (any)
* Rogue – Inquisitive, Scout

High-wisdom characters from pop culture include:

* Daryl Dixon from The Walking Dead
* Garrus Vakarian from Mass Effect
* Hawkeye from the Marvel movies
* Holo from Spice and Wolf
* Rei from Star Wars
* Toph Beifong from Avatar: The Last Airbender
* Wolverine from the X-Men franchise

## <a name="Charisma"></a>Charisma

Charisma can best be described as a force of personality and an ability to convince other people to do things. It’s often thought of as likeability, but that’s not necessarily true. Charismatic characters run the gamut from cunning and manipulative to charming and inspirational, and when they talk, people listen.

Charisma stats are entirely social and include Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion. Most of these are used in conversation, but performance is a bit more. It involves showmanship and musical performances, but also convincing acting and even things like riling up a crowd to stand against a noble’s tyranny.

A high-charisma character is going to jump in quickly to handle disagreements and calm things down when people are riled up. They know how to make introductions and win favor, and are typically generous with the people around them (or, at least, the people they want to garner favor with). They’ll rarely get flustered in a social situation and will often try to talk their way out of tense situations. It’s up in the air whether it’s better to be loved or feared, but high-charisma characters will definitely try for one of those.

Low-charisma characters are generally bad at getting other people to listen to what they have to say. This can sometimes mean they’re simply unlikeable, but it’s more likely to mean that they’re simply pushovers whom others don’t really listen to, or even invisible in most social situations.

Classes likely to have a high charisma include:

* Bard (any)
* Fighter – Champion, Purple Dragon Knight
* Paladin (any)
* Rogue – Swashbuckler
* Sorcerer (any)
* Warlock (any)

High-charisma characters from pop culture include:

* Capt. America/Steve Rogers from the Marvel movies
* Capt. Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean
* Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones
* Han Solo from Star Wars
* Leliana from Dragon Age
* Olivier Armstrong from Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood
* Star Lord from Guardians of the Galaxy

## <a name="Do-Stats-Limit"></a>Do Stats Limit What My Character Can Do?

Not necessarily. If you have a good plan as a player, a low-intelligence character shouldn’t be banned from talking about it (unless you want to). The random nature of rolls also means that a low-charisma character might roll higher than the bard on a persuasion check.

Low stats can be fun to roleplay, though. When creating Sha’Ivae, I intentionally gave him a really low charisma score (6), and it’s been fun roleplaying his hilariously incompetent attempts at persuasion. I highly suggest anyone, when creating a character, give thought not only to what they’re good at, but also to what they’re really bad at. Those moments can be very memorable.

## <a name="Are-Any-Better"></a>Are Any of These Better Than Others?

From a roleplaying perspective, no—each has a good place in the game and can make for a fun character. Think about what you want to focus on as a player and go with that, if your class allows some flexibility in build requirements. From a mechanical perspective, Wisdom skills are used slightly more frequently than Intelligence skills, although that’s not a reason to avoid one over the other. If you like jumping into conversations, Charisma can be very useful.
