Knowing what kind of armor to choose (ie – light, medium, heavy) can be confusing for newcomers and veterans alike. For instance, you might expect medium armor to protect better than light, but that's not always the case. Here’s a breakdown.

Note that discussion around many of these refers to a Dexterity bonus. The Dexterity bonus depends on your Dexterity Modifier. This is displayed above your Dexterity score on your character sheet, but to calculate it, subtract 10 from your Dexterity score, divide by 2, and round down if you have a decimal. For instance, a Dexterity score of 16 will equal a modifier of 3.

## Armor Comparisons

### Heavy Armor

Heavy armor protects well but inhibits movement. You gain the armor bonus, but no dexterity bonus. There are also strength requirements on heavy armor.

The best mundane heavy armor is Plate. This offers an armor class of 18 and has a Strength requirement of 15. It also gives disadvantage on Stealth.

**Ideal stat**: 15 Strength<br>
**Top AC**: 18

### Medium Armor

Medium armor protects pretty well, but allows for a little more movement. You gain the armor bonus and _some_ of your dexterity bonus (up to 2).

The best mundane medium armor is Half Plate. This offers an armor class of 15 and you can gain a maximum +2 bonus if you have 14 Dexterity for a maximum armor class of 17. Half Plate gives disadvantage on Stealth.

If you take the Medium Armor Master feat, you can gain up to a +3 bonus if you have 16 Dexterity and there’s no disadvantage on Stealth. Also, a Breastplate (AC 14) does not have a Stealth penalty.

**Ideal stat**: 14 Dexterity<br>
**Top AC**: 17

### Light Armor

Light armor doesn’t offer as much protection but allows for superior mobility. You gain the armor bonus and your full dexterity bonus.

The best mundane light armor is Studded Leather. This offers an armor class of 12 and you can gain a +5 bonus if you have 20 Dexterity for a maximum armor class of 17. There is no penalty on Stealth.

**Ideal stat**: 20 Dexterity<br>
**Top AC**: 17

## Which armor should I wear?
The first question to ask is which armor your character can wear. (Breakdown below.) Some classes, like Fighter, have proficiency in all three; some classes, like Cleric, only go up to Medium armor; some will even have no armor proficiencies and rely on other means of protection.

With those options in mind, the second question is whether you want to focus on Strength or Dexterity (or neither). Generally, if a class has access to all 3 types, it will be better to either focus on Strength and wear heavy armor, or focus on Dexterity and wear light armor. If you’re going to be maxing out your Dexterity, light armor has the same protection as medium armor and is only 1 point behind heavy armor. Most martial classes have options for both Strength- and Dexterity-based characters. If you don’t need maxed Strength or Dexterity (like a Cleric), you can go medium armor and aim for 14 Dexterity overall.

## Class Breakdown

### Artificer

The Artificer class itself gets access to light and medium armor. If you're not playing an Armorer (more on that in a moment), which armor you choose depends on if you want to max Dexterity or not. If you're planning on making your primary attack a crossbow or gun or something like that, it might make sense to max Dexterity, but weigh that against the option of maxing Intelligence, your spellcasting stat, first. Alchemists are more of a [Support](/5e-character-creation/party-roles/#BattleRoles-Support) subclass and will probably have better options than making weapon attacks frequently; Artillerists can be played as support characters or [Strikers](/5e-character-creation/party-roles/#BattleRoles-Striker); Battlesmiths can use Intelligence as their attack stat and don't need Dexterity or Strength. If you max Dexterity, light armor can work, but if you're going to prioritize Intelligence, medium armor might be a better fit.

The Armorer subclass has a feature that not only grants proficiency in heavy armor, but also removes the Strength restrictions, making that a great option for any Armorer that isn't concerned with stealth. If you _are_ concerned with stealth, some options make light armor work really well.

### Barbarian

Barbarians get access to light and medium armor but also have an option for unarmored defense that takes 10 plus their Dexterity modifier plus their Constitution modifier. Dexterity-based barbarians are possible, but many of their iconic features only work with Strength, so it's generally better to max Strength, meaning light armor is out. When choosing between medium armor and unarmored defense, it depends heavily on how much you're pumping Dexterity and Constitution. If you can get a total +7 modifier between Dexterity and Constitution, you can match half plate.

Early game, it's usually easier to go with medium armor. By mid-tier, you'll have had several more chances to boost your stats; but also bear in mind that you'll also probably have +1 or +2 armor at this point. If stealth is important to you, unarmored defense doesn't bring the penalty that half plate brings.

### Bard

Most bards only get access to light armor, so Dexterity is an important stat for them. Some of the more martial-focused subclasses (College of Swords and College of Valor) get access to medium armor; however, martially focused bards will probably want a good weapon stat, and Dexterity is still an easier pick for them than Strength, so light armor can work well if you're going to max out Dexterity.

### Cleric

The Cleric class itself gets access to light and medium armor, but some subclasses (Forge, Life, Nature, Order, Tempest, Twilight, War) also gain access to heavy armor. Dexterity Clerics are very possible, but usually require proficiency with martial weapons since there are few simple finesse weapons. Builds can be all over the place, so use the general advice above to pick your armor.

### Druid

Druids can't wear metal armor. It's up to you and your DM to determine how far that goes (i.e. - Does studded leather count as metal armor? Can you get a breastplate made out of a tough animal hide or non-metal material?), but Druids have notoriously low AC as a result. Going with a strict interpretation of the rules, you can wear hide armor, which is the entry-level medium armor, and 14 dexterity for 14 AC, or leather armor and max Dexterity for an AC of 16 (that goes down if you're not at max Dexterity). Druids are also proficient with shields, which helps a bit, but let's just say it's a good thing a lot of your attack spells are ranged.

Note that Druids also get access to Barkskin, a 2nd level spell that boosts your AC to 16. The spell lasts for 1 hour and does not require concentration. This might be a better choice for some Druids if you can give up the spell slot.

### Fighter

Fighters have access to light, medium, and heavy armor and can easily be built with either Strength or Dexterity. Generally, either max out Strength and go with heavy armor, or max out Dexterity and go with light armor. If you want to take the Medium Armor Master feat, though, medium armor can outpace light armor for Dexterity-based Fighters.

### Monk

Monks _cannot_ wear armor and use a lot of their class features. They get a class feature at level 1 for unarmored defense, that instead makes their AC equal to 10 plus their Dexterity modifier plus their Wisdom modifier.

### Paladin

Much like Fighters, Paladins have access to light, medium, and heavy armor and can easily be built with either Strength or Dexterity. Generally, either max out Strength and go with heavy armor, or max out Dexterity and go with light armor. If you want to take the Medium Armor Master feat, though, medium armor can outpace light armor for Dexterity-based Fighters.

### Ranger

Rangers get access to light and medium armor, so Dexterity builds are probably going to be best for them with light armor. Strength builds are possible, but it's generally easier to multiclass into either Fighter or Cleric to get access to heavy armor than to make a Strength build work with medium armor. That is possible, but your stats will be stretched pretty thin.

### Rogue

Rogues are all about Dexterity and only have access to light armor, so that's an easy choice.

### Sorcerer

Sorcerers don't get access to any armor, although they get access to the Mage Armor spell, which sets your AC at 13 plus your Dexterity bonus (equivalent to +1 Studded Leather Armor). The spell lasts 8 hours and does not require concentration.

### Warlock

Warlocks get proficiency with light armor, making Dexterity an important stat. the Hexblade subclass also gets proficiency with medium armor and shields.

### Wizard

Like Sorcerers, Wizards don't get access to any armor, although they get access to the Mage Armor spell, which sets your AC at 13 plus your Dexterity bonus (equivalent to +1 Studded Leather Armor). The spell lasts 8 hours and does not require concentration. Note, though, that the Bladesinging subclass does get proficiency with light armor.
