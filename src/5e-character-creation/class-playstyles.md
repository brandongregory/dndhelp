# Class Playstyles in DnD 5e
<p class="author">by Brandon Gregory</p>

If you're newer to DnD, or just haven't played some of the classes, you may be wondering what each of them is like. What's the difference between a Fighter and Barbarian, for instance, or a Sorcerer and a Wizard? Sometimes even reading the introductions in the handbooks don't give you a clear idea, and it can be hard to get that without getting way into the mechanics of each class.

This page is meant to give a basic overview on what each class does and how it plays. It's not a perfect guide, because some of the classes can be very diverse; however, this should give you a good general idea of how the classes are different and which might be best for you.

## <a name="Artificer"></a>Artificer

Artificers are a diverse half-caster class, and the biggest thing they bring to the table is versatility. They get access to a lot of utility magic, many tool proficiencies, and their subclasses allow them to fill a variety of roles. Depending on subclass choice, they can play reasonably well as support characters, tanks, ranged blasters, or frontline strikers. As high-intelligence characters, Artificers are skilled investigators and also often serve as a source of knowledge in many areas: magic, history, religion, or nature. They also gain the ability to create magic items which can be used either by them or other party members, which can make them more powerful, but can also give them more versatility, such as pulling out a cap that allows them to breathe underwater when no one else in the party is prepared to go diving.

Example: [Rocket Raccoon from Guardians of the Galaxy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1iEIoxd-4A)

Difficulty: ★★★★★

## <a name="Barbarian"></a>Barbarian

Barbarians are THE tank class. Their natural toughness and massive pool of hit points places them firmly on the front lines of combat where they can shrug off damage and hit back harder. They’re typically strong in every physical feat, from jumping across chasms to dodging fireballs to resisting the effects of poison. They also get some class features to enhance critical hits and get them more often, so if you’re looking for a critical hit build, barbarians are among the top picks. Compared to disciplined Fighters, Barbarians instead rely on their raw power and can jump right into battle rather than wait for the perfect moment.

Example: [Wolverine from X-men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3Slqc4wDYk)

Difficulty: ★★☆☆☆

## <a name="Bard"></a>Bard

Bards are the quintessential jacks of all trades and are able to fill a wide variety of roles, reminiscent of the old red mages of Final Fantasy games. They’re full casters and get good support and control options, but they can wear light armor and fight with weapons when needed. They get a lot of skill proficiencies and can fill any gaps in the party’s array of skills. Bards also have a lot of options for making the entire party stronger, making any ally more effective at what they do. As high-charisma characters, bards are notoriously strong social characters and natural performers.

Example: [Soul King Brook from One Piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isAb1S_yA74)

Difficulty: ★★★★☆

## <a name="Cleric"></a>Cleric

Clerics are full casters who wear armor, making them much more durable than most other spellcasters, and they actually do quite well on the front lines of combat. They have the best support magic, but a wide variety of subclasses allows them to serve just about any role on the battlefield, from ranged blaster to frontline warrior to trickster illusionist and even mind reader. They can also absolutely destroy undead monsters, which is nice flavor which comes in handy from time to time. Clerics gain their powers from a god, and there are a wide variety of gods to choose from, making many different character concepts possible.

Example: [Pike Trickfoot from The Legend of Vox Machina](https://youtu.be/oeRxeWIOjAI?t=120)

Difficulty: ★★★☆☆

## <a name="Druid"></a>Druid

Druids are nature-based spellcasters who get a lot of great support and control spell options, and some good attack spells. They can transform into various animals—typically weaker animals that are used more for utility, like turning into a hawk to scout ahead, but there is one subclass that can turn into more powerful animals for combat. Most druids will stay far away from the front lines, choosing instead to hinder enemies, support their allies, or use their magic and animal transformations for out of combat challenges.

Examples: [Layla from Sky High](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPmFZKrZ-mU) and [Beast Boy from Teen Titans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6kzB9qkoHA)

Difficulty: ★★★★★

## <a name="Fighter"></a>Fighter

Fighters are trained killers, having mastered multiple weapons and relying on their expert training when enemies face them. They can be built equally well with either strength or dexterity, and make great front-line characters or powerful archers. Their class features are almost entirely combat-based, so you won’t get much out of the class for out-of-combat challenges. More than any other class, though, Fighters are a blank slate, and any type of character you want can be a Fighter—if you want to be a standard knight, that works, but a Japanese-inspired swordsman or a Native American-style warrior can work just as well.

Example: [Hector vs. Achilles from Troy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ62frK74u0)

Difficulty: ★☆☆☆☆

## <a name="Monk"></a>Monk

Monks are highly mobile skirmishers. They can struggle when engaging strong opponents one-on-one, but their mobility and evasion skills often allow them to run right past the enemy’s frontline and attack the archers and spellcasters behind them, or employ hit and run tactics to wear enemies down. They get cool abilities, like being able to run up walls or catch arrows (and, in some cases, throw them back), and have an excellent stun attack. They’re also a great introduction to resource management, with ki points powering many of their abilities.

Example: [Tifa Lockhart from Final Fantasy VII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXOnj455QaE)

Difficulty: ★★☆☆☆

## <a name="Paladin"></a>Paladin

Paladins are half-casters, but they function more as strong martial characters who can use magic to boost some of their attacks. They get limited spell slots, like other half-casters, but can use these when a melee attack connects to apply additional smite damage to an opponent. This makes them great at applying burst damage when they need it, but resource management of the spell slots is also important. They’re prototypically strong defenders, but can be build to use two-handed weapons as well for extra damage. Their place is strongly on the front line, as their smite ability does not work with ranged attacks. Paladins gain their abilities from an oath which dictates what they must do. There are a variety of oaths available, but all Paladins will have a code of some sort that they live by.

Example: [Wonder Woman in Justice League](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpDYnfbD8lc)

Difficulty: ★★☆☆☆

## <a name="Ranger"></a>Ranger

Rangers are nature-themed half-casters who use their magic mostly to enhance their own attacks. They make excellent archers, but melee builds are also possible. They typically have a high Wisdom score, making them excellent at scouting and tracking, and have some of the Druid flavor while still having a strong martial striking ability. The biggest reason to play a Ranger, though, is just because you want to play a Ranger—they’re very flavorful, and no other class really captures the idea of a hunter tracking their prey through the woods like this class. They also get along really well with animals.

Example: [Daryl Dixon from the Walking Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WGjIXeJ1Tg)

Difficulty: ★★☆☆☆

## <a name="Rogue"></a>Rogue

Rogues are experts in stealth and subterfuge, often preferring to strike a vulnerable opponent than to take one head-on. Most of their damage comes from sneak attack, so rather than getting a bunch of attacks like a Fighter, they get one big attack per turn. They can get in trouble if a strong opponent focuses on them, but they have multiple abilities to either get themselves out of trouble or avoid damage. Out of combat, they have excellent stealth skills that can make them capable scouts or infiltrators, and they get more skill proficiencies than anyone except Bards, so they end up being good at doing a lot of things.

Example: [Wasp in Ant Man and the Wasp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvYtcQ5dNss)

Difficulty: ★★☆☆☆

## <a name="Sorcerer"></a>Sorcerer

Sorcerers are arcane casters—straight-up magic users with a variety of spells for attack, defense, and utility (though not many support options). Where they shine is in using sorcery points to bend the rules of magic—for instance, to cast a spell without anyone noticing or make some of their spells stronger. Flavor-wise, sorcerers are born with magical ability and often struggle early in life learning to control it. They make excellent blasters, so if you’re looking for an offensive spellcaster, this may be it.

Example: [Colonel Mustang from Full Metal Alchemist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-81rNhEwIY)

Difficulty: ★★★★☆

## <a name="Warlock"></a>Warlock

Warlocks are arcane casters that aren’t as diverse as Sorcerers or Wizards, but can do a few things really well. They get access to a powerful cantrip (basically, a level 0 spell that can be cast without using a spell slot) that levels up with them and becomes their main attack. Beyond that, they have great control and attack spells, but few spell slots to use, so they have to be very selective about when they cast full spells (although they get their spell slots back on a short rest, unlike other spellcasters). They also get to pick from a list of available features every few levels, giving them abilities like seeing in total darkness, improving their spell attacks, using magic to disguise themselves, or talk to animals. This makes them one of the most customizable classes in the game. Flavor-wise, they gain their powers from a pact with some sort of powerful creature (but not a god), which adds some interesting built-in flavor for backstories.

Example: [Raven from Teen Titans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lJcrW20DlM)

Difficulty: ★★★☆☆

## <a name="Wizard"></a>Wizard

Wizards are the ultimate magic users. Like sorcerers, they get powerful attack, defense, and utility spells, but they get to pick a lot more options, giving them unmatched versatility. They can make great blasters, but can also use magic to solve a lot of problems that might be difficult for other party members. Their control spell options are also fantastic, and a strategic Wizard can absolutely shut down an unprepared enemy party. Flavor-wise, Wizards are intelligence-based spellcasters who learned their magic through intense study, so Wizards usually roleplay as the character who has things figured out and has heard of the most powerful magic abilities and can gain knowledge when the party discovers the evil villain’s plot.

Example: [Dr. Strange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3zpIO5aeiw)

Difficulty: ★★★★★
