In gaming, tanking involves standing between the enemies and your more fragile allies to protect them from death and dismemberment. This is a very popular concept in video games but is more difficult in DnD due to the tank fallacy. There are few mechanics to force an enemy to focus on you, so nothing is stopping an enemy from running right around your Barbarian to attack the Wizard behind you. Despite these limitations, tanking can help your party and provide a fun way to play the game.

Since smart enemies will focus on high-threat targets, making yourself a major threat on the battlefield makes you a more effective tank. Some abilities make it harder for enemies to ignore you, making you a more effective tank. If you want a defensive powerhouse that protects other party members, here are some of the best ways to do that.

## Best DnD 2024 Classes and Subclasses for Tank Builds


### <a name="Barbarian-Path-of-the-Wild-Heart"></a>Barbarian – Path of the Wild Heart

While the Eldritch Knight focuses on avoiding damage, the Wild Heart Barbarian shrugs it off by having resistance to most damage. Combine that with the Barbarian’s high hit points and you have a very durable character. If you want the toughest character who’s nearly impossible to put down in a fight, the Wild Heart Barbarian might be for you.

In DnD 2014, the Totem Warrior was one of the best defensive options for having resistance to all damage except Psychic. While the 2024 version (now Path of the Wild Heart) dials that back a bit, now excluding Force, Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant damage, it’s still a great defensive option for players. One big improvement is its versatility. Previously, you had to choose a totem on level-up, locking you into a defensive build versus other options. With the 2024 version, you can pick a totem every time you rage, giving you much more versatility in battle to focus on defense, support, or mobility.

One important change is in the level 14 options—specifically, the Lion, which makes it harder for nearby enemies to target anyone _but_ you. Thanks to superior defensive traits and an actual tanking ability, the Wild Heart Barbarian is probably a best-in-class tank.

Strength is the most important stat for Barbarians and should be your priority with stat increases, but Dexterity and Constitution are both important. Barbarians cannot wear heavy armor, so you’ll need 14 Dexterity to get the most out of medium armor. Despite their high hit points, a good Constitution score helps any tank. Wisdom is also important because it’s a common saving throw for enemy spells. With so many important stats, most of your feats will be tied up in improving your stats, so don’t count on having too many other feats.


### <a name="Fighter-Eldritch-Knight"></a>Fighter – Eldritch Knight

Eldritch Knights are absolute tanks who use defensive magic to avoid enemy damage. Spells like Shield and Absorb Elements will be your bread and butter and other spells and cantrips can boost your melee damage or give you some potent ranged options.

Eldritch Knights are built for melee damage, so both Strength and Dexterity builds can work. If you want an agile and dextrous warrior, you’ll want to use a rapier and shield and take the Dueling fighting style. For strong warriors, Dueling is a good option for sword and board builds, but taking the Defense fighting Style and a great weapon is also a good choice. Intelligence is an important stat for Eldritch Knights, as that improves the effectiveness of many of your spells. If you don’t want to focus on Intelligence, you can compensate by taking spells that don’t require a saving throw.

Eldritch Knights can replace some of their melee attacks with cantrips (a change from the 2014 version, which required you to use a bonus action), so taking cantrips like Booming Blade, Green-Flame Blade, or Lightning Lure is a vital damage boost and provides some battlefield control options. Taking at least one of those cantrips is mandatory; taking several gives you more options for controlling enemies. Don’t feel bad about picking some utility cantrips, though.

Melee warriors should have ranged attacks as a backup, and having access to magic gives way more options to Eldritch Knights. Cantrips like Firebolt are good, but your Intelligence will likely be lower than a Wizard, so your accuracy might struggle to keep up with your melee abilities. Magic Missile is a fantastic way around that. While the damage might seem low, each missile is guaranteed to hit, so it provides reliable damage that scales with higher-level spell slots.

Besides attack spells, there are some basic spells that are helpful for Fighters. Misty Step, a basic teleportation spell, is great for any character. Expeditious Retreat gives you a burst of speed when you need it. Other spells like Detect Magic and Feather Fall are important for any party, so if you don’t have a caster ally who can take those spells, they’re important. Just be aware that you don’t have a lot of spell slots, so be careful with spell usage.


### <a name="Paladin-Oath-of-the-Ancients"></a>Paladin – Oath of the Ancients

Like Fighters, Paladins can use shields and all armor, making defensive builds pretty easy with the base class; but, of course, effective tanking requires more than that. The Oath of the Ancients Paladin is the best Paladin subclass for defending your allies. Couple that with the Ancients Paladin’s powerful offensive capabilities and you have a very capable tank.

At level 3, Ancients Paladins can use their Channel Divinity to restrain nearby enemies. This is great if you have allies behind the front line, like Warlocks, Druids, or ranged martials. Locking down enemies away from your allies allows you to defend a much larger area than other tank builds.

The Paladin aura at level 7 can help defend all nearby allies. The 2014 version of this aura was, frankly, overpowered, granting resistance to all magical damage. The 2024 version is still a powerful defensive option for your whole party, giving all nearby allies resistance to Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant damage. None of these are the most common types of damage, but if you’re dealing with enemy Clerics or undead foes, this feature can be a lifesaver.

Paladins are often built with high Strength, but Dexterity builds work equally well. With most of your damage coming from smites, sword-and-board builds work well. Charisma is important for spells and the saving throw for your level 3 ability, so don’t neglect that.

Ancients Paladins have many useful tanking spells including Compelled Duel, Protection from Evil and Good, and Protection from Energy. They also have useful support spells like Bless, Cure Wounds, and Shield of Faith. The Paladin’s iconic ability is smite, which uses spell slots, so don’t use all your spell slots on non-smite spells.


### <a name="Druid-Circle-of-the-Moon"></a>Druid – Circle of the Moon

Druids are nature-based casters who can use wildshape to transform into animals. For most Druids, wildshape provides utility options but not a lot of combat; however, the Moon Druid can turn into more powerful animals, making wildshape a viable combat feature. Even when you’re not wildshaped, you have a full list of Druid spells (including great support and control options), so you’ll always have something useful to do.

The way wildshape works, when you transform you gain the animal’s hit point pool. When you run out of animal hit points, you change back to your original form, but you can transform again for another pool of temporary hit points. This makes Moon Druids incredibly tanky, but also incredibly versatile with all of their spells and the regular Druid wildshape utility.

Compared to other tanks on this list, Moon Druids are not as offensively focused. That’s a fair tradeoff for all the other things the Moon Druid does well. But bear that in mind if you want to do a lot of damage.

As full spellcasters, Druids should focus on maxing out their spellcasting stat: Wisdom. Druids switch to the animal’s stat block when wildshaped, so Strength is not important. Druids can wear non-metal medium armor, but hide armor (medium) is roughly equivalent to studded leather (light) with 14 Dexterity, so feel free to use that. Constitution is doubly important, for keeping you alive but also helping you pass concentration checks—many of the most powerful Druid spell options require concentration, so passing those checks when you’re hit can really help.


### <a name="Cleric-Life-Domain"></a>Cleric – Life Domain

If you’ve played a lot of video games, you know that enemy healers should be the first thing you take out. Clerics are excellent healers but are also offensively powerful, making any Cleric on the battlefield a huge threat. With the new 2024 rules, any Cleric can choose proficiency in heavy armor and use a shield to make them as tanky as most martial characters (although they get fewer hit points than martials).

In DnD, healing to keep up with damage is usually inadvisable because it’s easier to kill enemies quickly and use healing for quick saves when someone is close to going down. Life Domain Clerics are the best healers in the game by a pretty wide margin and can make healing much more effective. It’s still better to focus on ending fights quickly, but Life Clerics have meaningful options for keeping their allies alive.

Despite the Life Cleric’s powerful offensive and support capabilities, they don’t have any features to force enemies to focus on them, so they’re not as useful at actually tanking as others on this list. They can hold their own on the front line, but their effectiveness as tanks relies on their threat to the enemy party.

Clerics are full spellcasters, so Wisdom should be a top priority with stats. For armor, you’ll want to aim for either 15 Strength (for heavy armor) or 14 Dexterity (for medium armor). Constitution is also important for passing concentration saving throws, so pump that as high as you can in your build.


## <a name="Best-Feats"></a>Best Feats for Tanks

The right feats can bring a Tank build from good to great. Here are some powerful options.


### <a name="Best-Backgrounds-and-Origin-Feats"></a>Best Backgrounds and Origin Feats for Tanks

* **Alert** - Positioning is important for tanks, so going earlier in battle can help you protect your allies. Available from the Criminal and Guard backgrounds.
* **Lucky** - At-will advantage and disadvantage are useful for any character. Available from the Merchant and Wayfarer backgrounds.
* **Magic Initiate** - There are a lot of good level 1 defensive spell options, and cantrips have many useful utility uses. Available from the Acolyte (Cleric), Guide (Druid), and Sage (Wizard) backgrounds.
* **Tough** - More hit points are always good, but this is probably most useful for tanks with lower HP, like Druids and Clerics. Available from the Farmer background.


### <a name="Best-General-Feats"></a>Best General Feats for Tanks

* **Heavy Armor Master** - This feat is improved from the 2014 rules, now scaling with your proficiency bonus. A few points of damage may not sound like a lot, but when you get it on multiple attacks per round, it adds up quickly.
* **Resilient** - The big three saving throws are Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom, and no class has more than one of these proficiencies. Even with high AC, failing a saving throw can take you out of the fight, so being better at them helps any tank. For spellcasters, proficiency in Constitution saving throws also helps you maintain concentration on spells.
* **Sentinel** - Probably a best-in-class tank feat, this allows you to hit an enemy moving past you and stop them in their tracks. This is amazing for keeping enemies away from your allies.
* **Slasher** - Reducing the speed of an enemy can make it harder for them to reach your allies.
* **War Caster** - Great for spellcaster tanks like Clerics or even half-casters like Paladins.
The key to a real poison-themed character is the Poisoner feat from _Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything_. This feat grants several benefits, most notably allowing you to ignore poison resistance on creatures and create several doses of a potent poison that can increase damage with weapon attacks. You don’t get unlimited poison, but you can choose when to apply it to your weapons, requiring some strategy on when to try for that damage boost.
