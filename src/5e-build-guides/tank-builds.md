In gaming, a Tank is an iconic role, drawing the enemies' ire so your more fragile teammates stay safe. Tanks in DnD work a bit differently. In video games, dedicated tanks will have methods of generating aggro, forcing nearby enemies to focus on them. There isn't really a mechanic for this in DnD. The Tank Phallacy in DnD is that you can build an extremely defensive character who can stand up to any attack, but there's nothing stopping an enemy from running right around you and attacking the wizard in back of you.

Playing a tank is deceptively hard. You need defense to stay alive, offense to make yourself a decent threat, and a mix of abilities to protect your allies and keep them (and yourself) alive. While a tank isn’t necessarily essential in a party, it can really help protect your allies. Here are 10 of the most effective tank builds.

## <a name="Class"></a>Best Classes and Subclasses for Tank Builds

### <a name="Class-Ancestral-Guardian"></a>Barbarian – Path of the Ancestral Guardian

Probably a best-in-class tank, the Ancestral Guardian takes the Barbarian’s natural durability and adds in some useful features for getting enemies to focus on you and not your allies. Barbarians are already fantastically durable, but you'll probably want to go weapon-and-shield, as your main goal will be getting the enemies to focus on you. If your main goal is to keep your allies from harm, this may be the best option. Of all the Barbarian classes, this is one of the least offensive, so make sure your allies can deal good damage. Also bear in mind that Barbarians typically have all of their high stats locked up in the three physical stats, so mental stats are typically low. This can mean you'll struggle against magical attacks.

Barbarians need a high Strength and Constitution, and a fairly high Dexterity, and you might want a mental stat with a decent score as well. With stats stretched so thin, the original Human may be a good choice, as they get a +1 to every stat. Mountain Dwarves, Half-Orcs, and Goliaths also make excellent Barbarians, with Goliaths in particular getting a useful ability to shrug off damage once a day.

### <a name="Class-Totem-Warrior"></a>Barbarian – Path of the Totem Warrior

While the Ancestral Guardian Barbarian focuses on drawing enemies' attention, the Totem Warrior adds some powerful defensive skills to the mix. Picking Bear totem at level 3 makes for an exceptionally durable character that can withstand enormous amounts of damage. Combined with the Barbarian’s high hit points, this character will be very tough to kill. On the flip side, you don’t get an option to incentivize enemies to target you until level 14, but the survivability of this subclass earns it a spot on the list. To get the enemies to attack you rather than your friends, you'll need to focus on doing as much damage as possible to make yourself a bigger threat, probably using great weapons and taking the Great Weapons Master feat.

Most of what makes a great Ancestral Guardian Barbarian applies here too. Original Humans can be good, as they get bonuses to many stats, and Mountain Dwarves, Half-Orcs, and Goliaths make excellent choices as well, with Half-Orcs getting numerous abilities that pair nicely with a damage-focused Barbarian.

### <a name="Class-Cavalier"></a>Fighter – Cavalier

The original knight in shining armor, the Cavalier has ways of incentivizing opponents to focus on you rather than your allies. Weapon-and-shield fighting and heavy armor are almost required, making you into a powerful defensive juggernaut, and at level 10, you gain most of the features of the Sentinel feat as a class feature. This is also the closest to a Medieval knight fantasy that you can get, so if you want a classic fantasy vibe, this is it. Compared to the Ancestral Guardian Barbarian, Fighters tend to get more attacks, but Barbarians hit harder and can shrug off more damage. You'll also get more ability score increases than any other class.

For a Cavalier build, Strength and Constitution are a must. You probably don't want Dexterity or Wisdom below 10, as those are common saves against spells, but 10 is still fairly low. That leaves some leeway for taking a third stat with a somewhat high score, giving you some control over what kind of character you want to roleplay. Races that get bonuses to Strength or Constitution work well here: Dwarves, Dragonborn, Half-Orcs, and Goliaths all work, and any race in Monsters of the Multiverse can be given a Strength increase.

### <a name="Class-Eldritch-Knight"></a>Fighter – Eldritch Knight

If defensive magic sounds fun but you still want to be a badass warrior, the Eldritch Knight Fighter might be a great fit. The Eldritch Knight gets access to a limited selection of spells, and most of the spells they get are defensive in nature, most notably allowing you to increase your armor class as a reaction or soak up elemental damage from a magic attack. The magic also grants you some additional attack and utility options, but Eldritch Knights are absolute tanks with their magic. There are a few other quirks, like being able to magically summon your weapon or attack _and_ cast a spell in one turn, but for the most part, they're full Fighters with superior defensive options.

Eldritch Knights can be built with either Dexterity or Strength, and typically have a higher Intelligence, although that's not strictly necessary. If you don't want to focus on Intelligence, just avoid spells that force a saving throw—there are plenty of good options that don't require a high Intelligence. A good Constitution score is useful for any Tank. Very diverse builds are possible here, so just about any race can work for an Eldritch Knight. I actually love the idea of a small race that uses magic to be tougher than anyone else in the party; bear in mind that small races are absolutely viable here.

### <a name="Class-Crown"></a>Paladin – Oath of the Crown

The fantasy version of Captain America, Oath of the Crown Paladins have ways of challenging individual opponents, potentially pulling the strongest enemies into combat with them and them only, and have ways of mitigating damage to nearby allies. They're fantastic defenders, and Paladins can get plenty of damage with their smites, freeing them up to use one-handed weapons and shields and still getting good damage output. Bear in mind that Paladins get their abilities from their oath, so the choice of subclass here has huge roleplay implications. Oath of the Crown Paladins are dedicated to their countries or aspects of society that are worth fighting for.

Paladins are usually Strength-based, but there's no reason a Dexterity-based Oath of the Crown Paladin wouldn't work. Strength-based builds usually go with heavy armor, which has a _slightly_ higher armor class than medium and light, but higher Dexterity builds (who usually go with light armor) are better with Dexterity saves and can avoid damage in other ways. Charisma is important for all Paladins and should be a second or third priority after Strength or Dexterity and possibly Constitution. Dragonborn have a bonus to both Strength and Charisma, making them good fits. With you drawing attention to yourself, sword and shield builds work well for the extra defense. Races that get a bonus to either Dexterity or Strength and Charisma are ideal. Thematically, the more populous races in your setting are more likely to have larger governments that would have a dedicated knighthood of Paladins. In many settings, this is humans, although this is far from a hard rule.

### <a name="Class-Ancients"></a>Paladin – Oath of the Ancients

Oath of the Ancients Paladins have some abilities for pulling individual opponents, though not as many as the Oath of the Crown. What really makes the Oath of the Ancients a defensive powerhouse is their aura ability at level 7 gives them and nearby allies resistance to all magic damage, which is really powerful. This later expands to a larger radius. They also get an ability at level 15 to just shrug off death once a day. Remember that Paladin oaths are a huge part of their characters, and that the Oath of the Ancients is one of the more unique oaths, being all about appreciating beauty and seeing the good in others and less about personal morality.

Most of what made a good Oath of the Crown Paladin also applies to Oath of the Ancients. Either Strength or Dexterity builds work, with Constitution and Charisma being important as well. Thematically, Oath of the Ancients is a great fit with elves, halflings, satyrs, and a few other off-the-beaten-track races—many of whom get bonuses to Dexterity. Many races can work here, though.

### <a name="Class-Armorer"></a>Artificer – Armorer

The D&D equivalent of Iron Man, Armorers enchant their armor to make them great tanks. Note that Armorers can choose one of two "models" for their armor: Guardian or Infiltration. Infiltration armor can be interesting, but if you want to be a Tank, Guardian is the way to go. Guardian Armorers gain a special melee attack that uses their intelligence and incentivizes enemies to focus on them. Additionally, armor that usually has a strength requirement has none for Armorers, so if you want a Gnome with 8 strength running around in full plate armor, that’s totally do-able, enabling a tank with Intelligence as their highest stat.

Artificers are half-casters and get a good amount of spells, so their spellcasting ability, Intelligence, is very important for them. Due to their class features, this is one of the only options that would be able to get away with not having Strength or Dexterity as their highest stat (although you can certainly use those stats in a build). Gnomes are a great fit for any Artificer, with a big boost to Intelligence and a reputation for being curious and tinkering with things. Feral Tieflings get a bonus to Dexterity and Intelligence. Kobolds and Warforged are good fits thematically and can work well as Artificers.

### <a name="Class-Moon"></a>Druid – Circle of the Moon

Druids are full spellcasters who can turn into animals. They're usually known for being rather fragile; but Circle of the Moon Druids can use their wildshape feature to transform into tougher animals than other Druids, and their hit points reset to the creature they transform into, essentially giving them a new pool of hit points for every encounter. When you’re not wildshaped, you’re a full caster with an excellent list of Druid spells. While not as damage-oriented as the Barbarian, Fighter, and Paladin builds, it’s hard to beat the versatility of the Circle of the Moon Druid. You can be a Tank when you need to be, and a control and support spellcaster when needed as well.

Since Druids use the animal stat blocks while wildshaped, Strength actually isn't important at all. Dexterity remains pretty important for Druids, as it affects their armor class while not wildshaped, but your highest stat as a Druid should be Wisdom, which is their spellcasting stat. Druids also use their animal stat blocks instead of weapons, so small races are perfectly viable. Races that get a bonus to Wisdom are great: Ghostwise Halflings, Hill Dwarves, Kalashtar, Firbolg, and Wood Elves are all great fits. Goblins can work pretty well too, and the idea of a Goblin tank will never not be funny to me.

### <a name="Class-Life"></a>Cleric – Life Domain

Clerics are armored casters who do well on the front lines. Life Domain Clerics get access to heavy armor and have enough offensive magic and weapon power to make themselves a decent threat on the battlefield. Couple this with the best healing abilities in the game and you have a character who can not only hold their own on the front lines, but keep the party alive better than any other support character. While many classes and subclasses get access to healing, Life Clerics are better than any of them at single-target heals, and by a pretty wide margin.

As spellcasters, Wisdom is the primary stat and should be high for Life Clerics. If you plan to use heavy armor, aim for at least 15 Strength so you can use plate mail. Dexterity builds are possible, but a little trickier due to the fact that Life Clerics do _not_ get access to martial weapons, and there's a real lack of finesse simple weapons. There are also few options for simple great weapons, so weapon and shield is what you'll want to go with. Humans, Hill Dwarves, Firbolg, and Genasi can make great Life Clerics, but any race that gets a bonus to Wisdom can work pretty well.

### <a name="Class-Forge"></a>Cleric – Forge Domain

Clerics are armored casters, but Forge Clercs take this to a new level by worshiping the gods of the forge and focusing on enhancing their weapons and armor. Forge Domain Clerics get access to both heavy armor and martial weapons, allowing them to sit comfortably on the front lines and dish out a decent amount of damage to make themselves a threat. Spells like Spirit Guardians can also do a lot of damage to enemies in melee range. Forge Clerics are durable and dangerous, and have access to the excellent Cleric spell list with great support options.

Everything that makes a good Life Cleric applies here too. Thematically, Dwarves are a very good fit, as smithing and forge work are huge parts of their racial culture. Hill Dwarves will get a bonus to Wisdom as well as Constitution, and an additional hit point per level. Mountain Dwarves get bonuses to Strength and Constitution and can work as more martial-based Forge Clerics.

## <a name="Feat"></a>Best Feats for Tanks

The right feats can bring a Tank build from good to great, and there are some really impactful options available.

### <a name="Feat-Sentinel"></a>Sentinel

Sentinel is a top feat pick for any Tank. This feat gives you three abilities, and all of them are amazing for Tanks. Being able to stop enemies dead in their tracks, in the middle of their turn, makes a Tank way more effective at protecting the people behind them, and being able to make opportunity attacks even when enemies disengage makes it hard for them to get away from you. Being able to attack a creature that's attacking one of your friends is also a really useful ability for Tanks. If you're planning on playing a Tank, this should be your #1 feat pick.

### <a name="Feat-Resilient"></a>Resilient

Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom saves are all pretty common, and no base class has proficiency in more than one. Picking Resilient to gain proficiency in another of these big three saving throws can really help Tanks, who will be in the thick of things all the time. Wisdom saving throws are particularly important, because Wisdom isn't a vital stat for many of the subclass options on this list, and failing a Wisdom saving throw can take you out of combat, or, even worse, turn you against your party.

### <a name="Feat-Alert"></a>Alert

Strength-based Tanks usually don't have a great bonus to initiative, but going earlier in battle can give a significant strategic advantage to a Tank. Getting a +5 bonus to initiative makes this much easier. Additionally, you can't be surprised, making it harder for enemy rogues to land sneak attacks on you, and invisible or unseen enemies no longer get advantage while attacking you—both very useful abilities for Tanks.

### <a name="Feat-Shield-Master"></a>Shield Master

If you're a shield user, Shield Master grants several benefits. It allows you to shove as a bonus action, which can be very powerful for Strength-based Tanks and gives you something to do with your bonus action. You can also add your shield's AC bonus to Dexterity saving throws, and you get the added benefit of taking no damage where passing a saving throw usually means that you take half damage. This can add up to a lot of protection, but can also help mitigate a mediocre Dexterity score.

### <a name="Feat-Slasher"></a>Slasher

Being able to reduce the speed of your foes makes it harder for them to get away from you—and closer to the people you're trying to protect. Giving enemies disadvantage on attacks can be really helpful, although it only happens when you make a critical hit, so it's not really reliable. The feat also comes with a +1 bonus to either Strength or Dexterity, which makes it easier to take to round out an odd stat. Note that you do have to attack with a slashing weapon in order to apply the effects of this feat.

### <a name="Feat-Heavy-Armor-Master"></a>Heavy Armor Master

While not as useful as many of the other feats on this list, Heavy Armor Master gives you a flat reduction to any non-magical physical damage that you take. This is amazing at the beginning of the game, although a bit underwhelming at higher levels. Even at those higher tiers of play, though, small reductions to damage can add up. Also bear in mind that most campaigns don't get past mid-tier levels. This is an underrated feat choice for Tanks.

### <a name="Feat-Tough"></a>Tough

Most martial classes get plenty of hit points, but if you're playing an Artificer or Cleric tank, the extra hit points can help you keep up with martial Tanks.

## <a name="Magic-Item"></a>Best Magic Items for Tanks

Magic items can really complete a build, and Tanks are no exception. But before that, two quick words on magic items for Tanks.

First is that defensive items are many in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, so those will be glossed over. Really, if any items boosts your defense, it can be a great magic item, and they're not worth mentioning individually. Enahnced armor and shields are top picks.

Second is that, while defense-boosting magic items are many, you actually don't want to become this impervious super-tank. Why? Because if the enemy can't hurt you, there's a good chance they're going to focus their efforts elsewhere. Also, if your DM knows they can't hurt you, they'll find ways around that. Defense is good, but too much defense can suck some of the fun out of the game.

That said, here are some top picks for magic items for Tanks.

### <a name="Magic-Item-Belt-of-Dwarvenkind"></a>Belt of Dwarvenkind (Rare)

Less necessary if your character is actually a dwarf, but this gives several bonuses that benefit Tanks. More Constitution is always good, and unless you've hit 20, this will give you a boost. Poison resistance and advantage on saves against the poisoned condition are useful as poison is one of the more common types all through the game. Lastly, if your character doesn't have darkvision, this can give you that very handy skill.

### <a name="Magic-Item-Mantle-of-Spell-Resistance"></a>Mantle of Spell Resistance (Rare)

This addresses one of the major weaknesses of most Tanks, and that is saving throws against spells, which bypass that really high AC you probably have. Your Constitution safes will probably be well, but Dexterity and Wisdom are pretty common saves, and there's the odd Charisma or Intelligence save that might devastate you. Gaining advantage on all saving throws against spells can improve your defense against spells by a hell of a lot.

### <a name="Magic-Item-Periapt-of-Wound-Closure"></a>Periapt of Wound Closure (Uncommon)

Simple but effective, this allows you to get much more healing out of your hit dice when you take a short rest or use an ability that restores health from your hit dice, making you much more self-sufficient in the healing department. Automatically stabilizing when you go down is also a really nice perk for Tanks.

### <a name="Magic-Item-Ring-of-Evasion"></a>Ring of Evasion (Rare)

You can absolutely be a Tank with a decent Dexterity score, but chances are it's not going to be nearly as high as some of your other stats, so the first Fireball that comes along can wreck you. This is basically a Get Out of Jail Free card for when you fail a Dexterity save. Unlike the Mantle of Spell Resistance, this applies to all Dexterity saves, not just magical ones, so dodging traps and other hazards is possible too.

### <a name="Magic-Item-Ring-of-Spell-Storing"></a>Ring of Spell Storing (Rare)

If you have spellcasters in your party who can recharge this regularly for you, it can offer a tremendous boost to your defense. Shield and Absorb Elements are great spells to keep charged, but spells like Hex and Hunter's Mark can boost your attack potential, and spells like Burning Hands can help you deal with crowds.

### <a name="Magic-Item-Cloak-of-Protection-Stone-of-Luck"></a>Cloak of Protection/Stone of Luck (Uncommon)

The Cloak of Protection and Stone of Luck are two different items, but the important thing is that both of them boost all of your saves by 1, addressing the problem most tanks have of failing tricky saving throws against debilitating spells.

### <a name="Magic-Item-Manual-of-Bodily-Health"></a>Manual of Bodily Health (Very Rare)

Boost Constitution by 2, and you can go above 20. Constitution is always good for Tanks.

### <a name="Magic-Item-Belt-of-Giant-Strength"></a>Belt of Giant Strength (varies)

Remember, part of being a Tank is being a big enough threat that the enemies can't ignore you. Boosting your Strength above 20 can be just as effective as getting a +x weapon. Also, what Tank wouldn't want a Strength of 29?
