Summoners are an iconic role in a lot of fiction. Characters like Lucy Heartfilia from _Fairy Tail_ or Yuna from _Final Fantasy X_ or even your favorite Pokemon trainer show how powerful summoner characters can be, and it’s a very specific power fantasy that’s hard to imagine as anything else. Can it be effective in DnD? With the right build and considerations, yes!


## Are Summoners Powerful and Effective in DnD 5e?

Where summoner characters shine is improving the action economy of your party. Action economy is how many actions you can take versus the enemy. This is a big reason why Sorcerers, who can use metamagic to cast an additional spell per turn as a bonus action, are considered powerful. Finding ways to get more actions per round is a big way to get an advantage over an enemy party.

This is why encounters against a single powerful foe are often easier than encounters against multiple weaker foes, even if the combined power of those weaker foes is less than that of the big foe. If your party gets way more actions per round than a powerful foe or opposing party, the enemy can find themselves outclassed by even a modestly powerful party.

Summoning spells essentially give you another party member, giving you another free action to use against opponents. That’s another chance to kill a weaker foe or break an enemy mage’s concentration, or a lot of other things. This is especially powerful in smaller parties, where another ally on the field is a greater percentage gain in actions, but it can be effective in large parties too.

A word of caution on summoner-type characters: adding more party members makes combat take longer. This won’t be too noticeable if you’re adding one party member through a summoning spell, but some spells can add multiple allies, and that can make combat drag out for everyone. Summon your creatures responsibly to make sure everyone at the table is having fun.

I’m covering full-casters and half-casters separately because they get spells at different levels, but some of the half-casters have class or subclass features that can make them competitive with full-caster classes.


## Summoning Spell Options by Class

Class and subclass features can be a big part of a summoner character, but spells are a huge part of that too and are a good indicator of how good a particular class is at this role. Here’s a list of the 31 summoning spells by spell level and what classes get access to them.

Note that, while most of these are Conjuration spells, a few are Necromancy spells. These are, by the loosest definition of the word, summoning spells, but they require certain _raw materials_ that the Conjuration spells don’t and may not fit some character concepts. Do what you want with this information.


## Summoner Class Breakdown - Full-Casters


### Wizard

Wizards get access to 21 of the 31 summoning spells and have good options at almost every spell level. Additionally, they’re able to learn more spells than any other class and have a core class mechanic for regaining a few spell slots in a day, so they don’t give up much by specializing in summoning spells. This is an easy fit for the summoner role.

Wizards are often thought of as frail, but between Mage Armor and Shield—two first level spells—they can be surprisingly resilient. One of the biggest challenges with summoning spells is maintaining your concentration. Avoiding hits is good for any character, but it’s doubly important for the Wizard because they have fewer hit points than most classes and so much of their power is wrapped up in concentration spells.

If you’re going all in on Conjuration spells, the School of Conjuration Wizard seems like it would be a good fit, but not as good as you may think. Wizards pay money for each spell that they learn, and Conjuration Wizards get a discount on Conjuration spells, making it easier to acquire these spells. Also, their level 10 feature, which makes it easier to keep your concentration, makes summoning easier to sustain. Aside from that, though, there’s not too much that gives this subclass an advantage.

If you’re open to a little upcycling, Necromancy spells grant a few more options and have a great synergy with the School of Necromancy subclass, which allows you to summon more undead and make them stronger. They also eventually gain a feature to out-Necromance other Necromancers, which can be thematically pretty great.

The War Magic subclass grants some features to help you avoid being hit in the first place, which helps with both concentration and survivability (because an alive summoner is much more effective than a dead one). This can be a great choice if you don’t want to worry about getting pummeled by enemies.

Spell options: 5

Class features: 2

Role fit: 5


### Warlock

As DnD’s occult enthusiasts, Warlocks don’t have many spell slots to cast spells, but have a surprising number of spell options, coming in second place (12 out of 31). Casting a summoning spell means giving up a valuable spell slot for a Warlock, but they thankfully have other things they can do that don’t require spell slots.

Warlocks have good defensive features as well. They’re able to wear light armor, which basically eliminates the need for the Mage Armor spell (although they have a feature to cast it for free). They have a d8 hit die rather than the Wizard’s d6, so they’ll usually have more hit points. If you take the Hexblade subclass, you get many more defensive options like medium armor and shields. They don’t get access to the Shield spell (and probably shouldn’t cast it anyway, with so few spell slots), but their defensive options are considerable.

Where Warlocks shine as summoners, though, is in their class features. Warlocks get to pick a Pact Boon at level 2 that gives them an additional feature, and Pact of the Chain gives them a little summoned sidekick that can add some significant damage early on. Warlocks can also gain features as they level up that make these summoned creatures stronger, keeping them relevant as you get stronger. So if you want a dedicated summoned creature, Warlocks are amazing for that.

The Fathomless subclass also allows you to summon a giant tentacle that acts like a pet and helps you in combat. While this ties in with the creepy nautical theme of the Fathomless Warlock, it can easily be reflavored into another kind of summon. The Fathomless subclass is often underrated and can make a great summoner.

Spell options: 4

Class features: 4

Role fit: 3


### Druid

Druids are the ultimate friends of nature and appropriately have spells for summoning animals and nature spirits to aid them. They have the third highest number of spells (11 out of 31) and their role as [support](/5e-build-guides/support-caster-builds/) characters means they can help make their summoned creatures stronger.

That said, Druids have famously low survivability, so they’ll have a harder time maintaining their concentration than a class with better defenses (like the Wizard and Warlock, also ranking highly on this list). They can wear armor, but with the restriction of not being able to wear metal armor, their armor class is lower than you might think. 

Druids also have a lot of amazing spells that require concentration, which means you’d be giving those up to maintain the summon. While Druids don’t get any core class features that make them better summoners, though, some subclasses do help.

The Circle of the Shepherd subclass is all about summoning and boosting the power of all of the creatures that you summon, meaning you can have a small zoo of animals fighting for you with the Conjure Animals spell. This subclass is probably a top pick for a summoner subclass, so that alone gets a lot of points. Bear in mind, though, that this subclass is notorious for making combat last longer.

The Circle of Wildfire subclass gives you a fire spirit sidekick that can be used for many useful things, which doesn’t really help with the summon spells, but could easily be flavored as a summon on its own.

Spell options: 4

Class features: 3

Role fit: 3 (5 for Shepherd)


### Cleric

While the top 3 options in this list make great summoners, the bottom 3 are pretty lackluster. Coming in as the best of the worst is Clerics. Clerics get the next highest number of summoning spells, but this is much lower than the other full-caster classes: only 5 out of 31. Thankfully the options they do get are powerful, including the only summoning spell option for a level 7 spell. They can make good summoners at higher levels, but the low levels don’t have many options.

One thing Clerics do have going for them is amazing survivability. Clerics can wear armor and use shields, making them the most durable full-casters, and they have a d8 hit die, which means they typically have more hit points than Wizards and Sorcerers. Between their armor and shields, they’ll have a much easier time maintaining concentration on their summons.

Other class options are mildly useful for a summoner, mainly because Clerics make amazing [support](/5e-build-guides/support-caster-builds/) characters and can support their summoned creatures as well as their fellow party members, but otherwise don’t have any summoner-related class features to speak of.

Spell options: 2

Class features: 1

Role fit: 1


### Sorcerer

Sorcerers make great [blasters](/5e-build-guides/blaster-caster-builds/) and have some other useful tricks up their sleeves, but they make terrible summoners. They learn fewer spells than most other full-casters and have fewer spell slots, so summoning is a harder thing to fit into a build. Additionally, they have only 2 summoning spell options, giving them few options.

Sorcerers do have most of the same defensive options as the Wizard (the Shield and Mage Armor spells), and the Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer basically gets Mage Armor for free.

The Shadow Magic Sorcerer does get a summoned creature, and that can be a good dedicated pet. Even with this, though, most other options on this list make better summoners.

Spell options: 1

Class features: 1

Role fit: 1


### Bard

Bards get only 1 option for a summoning spell (Unseen Servant), and it’s more of a utility spell than an actual summoning spell, making them only slightly better than Barbarians. Bards are not summoners. They’re great [support](/5e-build-guides/support-caster-builds/) characters, though, so you can technically keep another party member’s summon alive longer.

_That said_, Bards can use their Magical Secrets feature (levels 10, 14, and 18) to get a summon spell from another class’s spell list, so they can have one or two staple options from another class once they hit those levels. This does mean giving up some powerful other options, so weigh this option carefully.

Bards do have decent survivability with light armor. If you pick the College of Swords or College of Valor subclass, you get access to medium armor as well. Despite these features, though, Bards seem like support casters with a single trick they can pull in when needed—and they often have a lot of other great options they could be doing instead.

Spell options: 1

Class features: 1

Role fit: 1


## Summoner Class Breakdown - Half-Casters


### Ranger

Half-casters gain spells more slowly than full-casters, so it’s hard to compare a half-caster’s spell list to a full-caster. That said, Rangers have more summoning spell options than Clerics, Sorcerers, or Bards (6 of 31), so they’re actually more well-suited to the task than these three full-casters. They also have a good selection of lower-level summoning spells, making them the most effective summoning half-casters.

As half-casters, Rangers have great survivability, having access to both light and medium armor and shields, so they’ll be better at maintaining their concentration than most full-casters.

Where Rangers shine, though, is with what is probably the most iconic pet subclass in the game: the Beast Master. The entire Beast Master subclass is built around a pet, which could easily be reflavored as a summoned creature. The Beast Master’s companion also gets stronger based off of a Ranger’s Wisdom, making Beast Masters one of the best magic users among martials.

The Fey Wanderer subclass also works well with Wisdom builds and gets access to the Summon Fey spell at level 11, so they can make good summoners too.

Spell options: 3

Class features: 2 (4 for Beast Master)

Role fit: 2 (4 for Beast Master or Fey Wanderer)


### Artificer

Artificers have only a single option for summoning spells: Summon Construct. It’s a fairly powerful one, as a level 4 spell, but bear in mind that Artificers don’t get level 4 spells until level 13, making this a hard sell as a summoning class.

Like the other half-casters, Artificers are durable and will have an easier time maintaining their concentration than most full-casters. Some subclasses also get access to the Shield spell, making them very tanky when needed.

Artificers do get a class feature that gives them a small summoned creature: the Homunculus Servant infusion, available at level 2. This gives a small but useful ally that can help you in combat. This doesn’t really feel like a summon, as it’s not very powerful, but it allows you to cast your spells from a distance and can help in other ways besides raw damage.

One Artificer subclass does get an additional feature that helps: the Battle Smith, which gets a Steel Defender, a dedicated pet that helps much like the Beast Master Ranger’s pet. With the technology focus of the Artificer, it can be hard to think of them as summoners, but they get close to Rangers with that subclass.

Spell options: 1

Class features: 2 (4 for Battle Smith)

Role fit: 2 (3 for Battle Smith)


### Paladin

While Paladins do get one notable summoning spell—Summon Celestial, a 5th-level spell—they’re not able to cast it until level 17. They do technically get 2 other summoning spells, but they’re not useful as actual summoned creatures. Unlike the other two half-caster classes, Paladins get no real class features to make them better summoners, making them a bad fit for the summoner role. Bottom line: unless you really like horses, don’t choose this as a summoner class.

Spell options: 1

Class features: 1

Role fit: 1


## Best Feats for Summoners


### Resilient (Constitution)

If you don’t already have proficiency in Constitution saving throws, gaining it can really help you keep your concentration on summon spells.


### War Caster

Similar to Resilient, having advantage on your concentration saving throws makes it much harder for enemies to make your summon go away.


### Moderately Armored

This requires that a class already be proficient with light armor, but gaining medium armor allows you to have a good armor class with lower Dexterity. Gaining shield proficiency as well can make you much harder to hit. This is a great option for Warlocks in particular.
