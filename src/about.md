# About This Site

The author of this site is Brandon Gregory, a Kansas City [web developer](http://brandongregorycreative.com), musician, [podcaster](https://peculiarpicture.show), and [amateur film critic](https://brandontalksmovies.com). I'm a compulsive writer, and as I was learning more about DnD, I just started writing things out, and this site is what came out of those early articles.
