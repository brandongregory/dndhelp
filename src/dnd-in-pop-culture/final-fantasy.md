Final Fantasy has its own robust class system and there aren't always exact matches to the DnD world, but some of the characters are just so iconic that they're worth looking at in DnD. Sorted by game. I'm also adding to this section, so if you don't see what you want, check back later!

## Final Fantasy IV

Final Fantasy IV was a classic that drew me into the Final Fantasy world for the first time and features some unforgettable characters. The game had a pretty solid class system from older titles that gave us well-defined characters like a paladin and a monk rather than a blank canvas, so the DnD parallels work well here.

## Final Fantasy VI

Final Fantasy VI dominated my imagination earlier in my life, and I still fondly remember the characters and settings from the game. While the esper system allowed for all characters to learn the same magic, each character had unique abilities and proficiencies that made them all distinct. Many of the character from FF6 work in DnD.

## Final Fantasy VII Remake

Final Fantasy VII was an amazing game for its time, and the remake not only fleshed out more of the story, but fixed a lot of the things that didn't age well in the original game. Each of the characters (that we've seen so far) has a unique fighting style that translates well to a DnD setting.

## Final Fantasy X

Final Fantasy X was a milestone for the series: it was the first game in the more powerful Playstation 2, and the first game with voice acting. The voice direction and editing left a little to be desired, but the story was still deep and moving, and the characters each brought something special to gameplay (except Kimahri). With such strong character roles, it's easy to draw parallels to DnD.
