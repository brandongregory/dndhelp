# Final Fantasy Characters in DnD

Final Fantasy has its own robust class system and there aren't always exact matches to the DnD world, but some of the characters are just so iconic that they're worth looking at in DnD. Sorted by game. I'm also adding to this section, so if you don't see what you want, check back later!

## Final Fantasy IV

Final Fantasy IV was a classic that drew me into the Final Fantasy world for the first time and features some unforgettable characters. The game had a pretty solid class system from older titles that gave us well-defined characters like a paladin and a monk rather than a blank canvas, so the DnD parallels work well here.

## Final Fantasy VI

Final Fantasy VI, originally released in the US as Final Fantasy III, broke the mold with the esper system. Characters became a lot more flexible, allowing even meatheads like Sabin to become powerful mages; but almost every character had a unique class skill that set them apart. Here are some DnD approximations.
