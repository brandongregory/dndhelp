# Celes from Final Fantasy VI in DnD

<img src="/images/ff6-celes.webp" alt="Celes Chere from Final Fantasy VI" class="pull-right" style="max-width: 200px;">

Much more than some opera floozy, Celes was a general in the Gestahlian Empire who defects and joined the resistance. Much like other leading lady Terra Bradford, Celes has pretty solid fighting abilities, able to equip most weapons and wear most armor, but is also one of the few characters in the game to learn magic naturally. Her Runic Blade ability allows her to nullify harmful spells cast against the party, making her invaluable when facing enemy mages. This concept actually has a pretty similar build in DnD, so read on!

## Picking a Class and Subclass

As a magic knight-type character, Celes has solid fighting and magic abilities. The closest equivalent in DnD is a Paladin, having much of the offensive and defensive capabilities of the best martial classes while also packing a magic punch with smites and some limited spells. A lot of the offensive power of Paladins comes from smites, so a Dexterity build can work just as well as a Strength build for a Celes-type character.

For subclass, we have to consider Celes's unique ability. Her Runic Blade allows her to absord enemy magic. The best Paladin subclass fit is Oath of the Ancients, which gets an aura ability that grants resistance to all damage from spells. That right there is as close to Runic Blade as you're going to get in DnD. Oath of the Ancients Paladins also have some nature-themed spells and abilities, including some control options.

If the nature theme isn't doing it for you and you'd rather lean into Celes's story than her mechanical elements, Oath of the Crown might be a good fit. As a former general, Celes was devoted to her country, but moreso the Oath of the Crown tenets of Law, Loyalty, Courage, and Responsibility. When her country could no longer fulfill her ideals, she defected, initially having nothing but her ideals, but learning to redirect those ideals into something bigger than herself.

I'm guessing you're probably wanting to play more into the mechanical aspects of Celes's character, though, so I'm recommending Oath of the Ancients.

## Picking a Race

As an archer, Rose would have a high Dexterity in addition to the Wisdom required for Clerics. Between a need for Dexterity and a natural proficiency in archery, Wood Elf is a great fit. If you ended up picking Life Domain over War Domain, Wood Elves have proficiency with longbows, making archery a much more formidable part of their arsenal. They also have proficiency in Perceptionâ€”a useful skill for any archer. The stealth abilities aren't really something Rosa had in the game, but they fit with the character build overall.

If you want to lean into Rosa's background with an established kingdom with its own knights, a Human might be a good fit as well. A Variant Human can boost Dexterity and Wisdom, as well as pick up the Sharpshooter feat at the first level, which can be great if you go with the War Domain.

## Background, Alignment, and Personality

There are two backgrounds that can fit Rosa.

Acolyte is a natural fit for just about any Cleric, and really plays into Rosa's desire to really study the healing arts to further her goals in life. As an Acolyte, devotion isn't just a virtue; it's a way of pursuing the life she wants. For a War Domain Cleric, this ties in naturally to the desire to go save the world with an adventuring party. Rosa is a healer, but she will do anything in her power to stop the evil she sees around her.

The Noble background can also be an interesting fit, especially if you want to tie her character's story in with another party member with ties to a nation or house. Rosa wants to go protect Cecil, but she's also driven by a desire to stop the evil she saw taking root in Baron, and that's something she saw clearly because of her proximity to the higher-ups in the castle. A Cleric who sets out to stop an evil entrenched in a powerful government is a hell of a story hook and can make for a very interesting character.

Alignment is pretty clear-cut: Rosa is Neutral Good. She's not chaotic by any stretch, but she has no trouble overthrowing a government if their goals are evil. Rosa will always choose what is good, but isn't necessarily bound by existing laws and established powers.

As a character, Rosa is interesting. For most strong characters, things like mercy and kindness exist mostly to keep more dominant aspects of their strength in check. For Rosa, mercy and kindness are major strengths. Her desire to stop Baron sets her on a journey that she's initially unprepared for, but she goes out alone because she knows it's the right thing to do. When the only path forward was through an ice wall, it was Rosa's kindness that was the show of strength that Rydia needed to overcome her trauma and cast a fire spell. There's always a lot of muscle in the Final Fantasy IV parties, but there's not always a lot of heart. Cecil and Edward tried, but were so unsure of themselves that they struggled in that role. Rosa acts confidently anytime a big heart is needed, and that really steers the party in some pivotal scenes.
