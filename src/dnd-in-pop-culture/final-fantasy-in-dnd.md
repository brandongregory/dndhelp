# Final Fantasy Characters in DnD

Final Fantasy has its own robust class system, so there aren't always exact matches, but the characters on this list had pretty good fits. Sorted by game.

## Final Fantasy IV

Final Fantasy IV was a classic that drew me into the Final Fantasy world for the first time and features some unforgettable characters. The game had a pretty solid class system from older titles that gave us well-defined characters like a paladin and a monk rather than a blank canvas, so the DnD parallels work well here.

### Cecil Harvey

Our beloved protagonist begins the game as a dark knight, for which there's no real DnD equivalent, but quickly transforms into something more recognizable. It's not a far stretch to say that Cecil would be an **Oath of Devotion Paladin**. Sure, it's a bit of a generic choice for a paladin, but Cecil is your quintessential paladin, so the archetypal choice is the best one here. With his Lunarian heritage, the **Aasimar** race is a good fit

### Edward Chris von Muir

While there are other good bard equivalents in Final Fantasy games, Edward takes the title of bardiest bard to ever bard, so it's natural that he takes the subclass that basically enhances the core bard features and makes them stronger. Edward would be a **College of Lore Bard** and makes other bards look like karaoke artists on amateur night. With his royal heritage, **Human** is actually a good fit for this bardy prince.

### FuSoYa

FuSoYa is an interesting case, because he has a lot of great healing spells but some great damage spells as well. With the breadth of his magical knowledge, an **Arcana Domain Cleric** is actually a great fit, as it has access to some of the best support spells, but also access to a lot of Wizard spells for added versatility. Sticking with Cecil's racial choice, FuSoYa would probably be an **Aasimar**, although a case could be made for **Kalashtar**.

### Rosa Joanna Farrell

The white mage who stole Cecil's heart, who also happens to be a crack shot with a bow, is an interesting case because it really depends on if you want to lean more into her skills as a support character or lean more into the independent adventurer side of her. I can see Rosa as either a **Life Domain Cleric** or a **War Domain Cleric** depending on whether you want her to be an ultimate healer or a badass with a bow who can also heal really well. For race, **Wood Elf** would be a great fit, as they're innately skilled with bows, but with her stoic nature, a case could also be made for **Kalashtar**.

### Tellah

![Tellah from Final Fantasy IV](/images/ff4-tellah.webp)

For the time you have him, Tellah is a master of magic, learning both damage and support spells, and is the source of a lot of magical knowledge for the party. He's a clear fit for a **School of Evocation Wizard**, learning more spells than anyone else in the party and being an expert on magical matters. For race, I think **Forest Gnome** is the race most likely to say something like, "You spoony bard!"

### Yang Fang Leidan

![Yang Fang Leidan from Final Fantasy IV](/images/ff4-yang.webp)

Yang is obviously a Monk, but the subclass gets a little tricky. Monks in DnD are known for being highly mobile skirmishers, but not necessarily great in a straight fight; Yang is a heaping pile of muscle and hit points. For his survivability, a **Way of the Long Death Monk** is the top choice, giving him additional hit points and survivability that many other Monks lack. With his noble heritage, a **Human** would probably be top pick for race.

## Final Fantasy 6

With the esper system, characters became a lot more flexible, allowing even meatheads like Sabin to become powerful mages, but almost everyone had a unique class skill that set them apart. Here are some DnD approximations.

### Celes Chere

![Celes Chere from Final Fantasy VI](/images/ff6-celes.webp)

Not to be mistaken for some opera floozy, Celes' signature ability is her Runic Blade, which allows her to absorb harmful magic before it can hurt her party. Between that and her natural combat skills, an **Oath of the Ancients Paladin** is a great choice for its aura ability to help lessen the effect of harmful magic to allies within range. As a Paladin, she would also have access to all weapons and armor, allowing her to be the badass general that she is. With the magical treatments she received as a child, **Aasimar** is a good fit for race.

### Cyan Garamonde

![Cyan Garamonde from Final Fantasy VI](/images/ff6-cyan.webp)

Cyan is a clear cut **Samurai Fighter** and it's not even close. From the Japanese-influenced culture of Doma to his skill with a katana to his strict code of conduct, this was an easy pick. For race, with Cyan's strength and sense of honor, **Dragonborn** would be a great fit.

### Edgar Figaro

![Edgar Figar from Final Fantasy VI](/images/ff6-edgar.webp)

The horny king of Figaro is also a genius inventor who uses his tools to enormous tactical benefit, so **Battlesmith Artificer** is a top pick for Edgar. While a top-notch inventor and user of tools, Edgar is also a powerful fighter, able to use most weapons and armor, so Battlesmith fits the bill, getting him access to martial weapons and granting him an additional attack. With his royal heritage, **Human** would be a good fit for race.

### Gau

![Gau from Final Fantasy VI](/images/ff6-gau.webp)

Resident wild child Gau actually has a signature technique called Rage, making him a great fit as a Barbarian. He fights with the power of beasts, so Gau would be a **Path of the Beast Barbarian**, using natural weapons and taking on some of the bestial qualities of the animals he studies. With his animal nature, **Shifter** would be a good fit for race, but a case could also be made for **Orc**.

### General Leo Christoph

![General Leo from Final Fantasy VI](/images/ff6-leo.webp)

That's right, General Leo makes the list! With his ability to fry things and his deep devotion to his kingdom, Leo's a natural fit for an **Oath of the Crown Paladin**. Crown Paladins are natural defenders, but their Paladin smite ability gives them fantastic attack power as well. With his ties to the Gestahlian Empire, **Human** would be a good choice for race, but a case could also be made for half-races like **Half-Elf** or **Half-Orc**.

### Locke Cole

![Locke Cole from Final Fantasy VI](/images/ff6-locke.webp)

With his finesse and stealth skills, Locke would be great as a **Thief Rogue**. Locke has a tendency to climb up in the rafters and sneak around, and his thievingâ€”I'm sorry, _treasure-hunting_ skills are a good fit thematically. Being a sneaky but big-hearted treasure hunter, **Lightfoot Halfling** would be a fantastic fit for race.

### Sabin Figaro

![Sabin Figaro from Final Fantasy VI](/images/ff6-sabin.webp)

The prodigal prince of Figaro left his royal home to train in martial arts, but his ability to shoot beams of energy at his opponents makes him a good fit for the **Way of the Sun Soul Monk**. Sabin's Aura Bolt Blitz is about as clear cut an example of Sun Soul energy blasts as you can get in Final Fantasy. For race, Sabin would likely be a **Human** like his brother, due to his royal heritage.

### Shadow

![Shadow from Final Fantasy VI](/images/ff6-shadow.webp)

The mysterious mercenary ninja Shadow can actually go a few different ways. A very strong case could be made for a **Assassin Rogue**, but his unique ability to throw weapons is actually a great fit for a **Soulknife Rogue**, as their signature ability is also throwing knives (albeit of psychic origin). If the idea of throwing an endless supply of daggers seems like your cup of tea, this is the route I'd recommend. Race options are actually very open, as Shadow has such a mysterious past, but **Wood Elf** would give you a few stealth abilities and an essential dexterity boost.

### Terra Bradford

![Terra Bradford from Final Fantasy VI](/images/ff6-terra.webp)

Terra is an interesting case, because she's one of the premier magic users of the group, but she's also fairly proficient in attacking with weapons. This interesting mix can be realized in a **Bladesinging Wizard** (although a case can certainly be made for **Hexblade Warlock** as well). This will give Terra all the magical skills she needs while still allowing her to be a threat with her blades. Being half human and half esper, **Fire Genasi** makes a lot of sense for her race.

### Umaro

![Umaro from Final Fantasy VI](/images/ff6-umaro.webp)

If Gau is a Barbarian for using his rages sometimes, Umaro deserves the same honor because the guy never stops raging. Specifically, Umaro would be a **Path of the Storm Herald Barbarian** to get some of his weather effects in there with his rage. Umaro himself is some sort of abominable snow monster, and there's not a direct equivalent in the DnD world, but I think **Bugbear** will get you pretty close. Maybe you can be an arctic Bugbear.

## Final Fantasy 7

The materia system in Final Fantasy 7 made building a characters a lot more uniform, and I actually miss the charm of having certain characters that were shoehorned in for one role, but between the stats and limit breaks, I think there are enough distinctions to draw some DnD equivalents out of these characters.

### Aerith Gainsborough

![Aerith Gainsborough from Final Fantasy VII](/images/ff7-aerith.webp)

We meet Aerith, or Aeris, as she's tending to her garden and soon find out her life is centered around taking care of her ailing mother, and it's clear that Aeris's character is all about helping people. She has the best magic stats in the game and her limit breaks are all supportive in nature. For both personality and skills, it seems that a **Life Domain Cleric** is a great fit for Aeris. For race, the new **Astral Elf** from the new Spelljammer supplements seems a great fit.

### Barret Wallace

![Barret Wallace from Final Fantasy VII](/images/ff7-barret.webp)

Barret has a powerful physique, but his actual fighting style is all done with his gun arm. He also has a habit of planting bombs at government facilities. With his penchant for bullets and bombs, it makes sense for Barret to be a **Artillerist Artificer**, giving him a small cannon as a class feature. With his big muscles and gruff personality, he could easily be a **Mountain Dwarf**.

### Cloud Strife
