Dragon Age is a high-fantasy world, much like most DnD settings, but there are some differences in how characters are built. Some of the characters, though, have fantastic analogies in DnD and are worth looking at. Sorted by game. I'm also adding to this section, so if you don't see what you want, check back later!


## Dragon Age 2

For all its faults, _Dragon Age 2_ had a great cast of characters with real chemistry together. It was fun seeing them all gather for drinks at the Hanged Man, or pursue their own goals in a city that felt alive. It's no surprise that some of the characters here work well as DnD characters.

## Dragon Age: Inquisition

The Dragon Age series has always been great, but Inquisition brought things to a new level with intricate quests, huge maps, and fascinating and deep characters. Companion characters felt more alive and real than they ever had, and many of them work really well as DnD characters.
