_Wondrous Item, rare, requires attunement_

This tattered mantle was a gift from a hag. It carries several benefits for you, but also benefits the hag who gave it to you.

While wearing this belt, you gain the following benefits:

* Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.
* You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
* You have advantage on Investigation checks made to see through illusions and disguises.
* You can speak, read, and write Sylvan.

Additionally, while wearing this belt, you gain the following effects:

* Whenever you eat or drink something, 50% of whatever you eat or drink is magically transported to the hagâ€™s location to nourish one of her subordinates. You must eat and drink twice as much as you normally would to receive the same effect.
* Whenever you make a Stealth or Deception check to fool the hag or one of her subordinates, that Stealth or Deception check is made with disadvantage.
* You cannot hide yourself from divination magic cast by the hag or one of her subordinates, even with spells like Nondetection or similar effects.
* If you remove this item or your attunement to the item is otherwise broken, the hag knows your exact location at the moment the attunement was lost.
