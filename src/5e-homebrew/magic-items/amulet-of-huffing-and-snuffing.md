_Wondrous Item, uncommon_

While holding this amulet, you can sharply exhale and snuff out all candles, torches, and small campfires within 30 feet. Also, anyone within 10 feet of you when you do this gets their hair all messed up. You can use this effect once per day and the amulet regains its charge at dawn each day.
