It’s said that the first dragon knights were trained by Bahamut himself and tasked with keeping the world safe from evil. Regardless of their origins, their techniques have been passed down to you. Dragon Knights have an impressive acrobatic fighting style, often relying on agility rather than raw strength, and can summon spectral spears to fight with. 

## Dragon Tongue

_3rd-level Dragon Knight feature_

You gain the ability to speak, read, and write Draconic.

## Dragon Knight Technique

_3rd-level Dragon Knight feature_

You learn the signature acrobatic fighting style of the dragon knights. You gain expertise in the Acrobatics skill, your jump distance is tripled, and you can fall up to 20 feet and take no damage. (Moving horizontally while jumping still takes movement and you cannot jump farther than your movement would allow.) You do not incur opportunity attacks for vertical jumps, provided you land in the same place you started.

Additionally, as a part of your attack action, you can summon a spectral spear. This spear is a finesse weapon that does 1d8 + your Dex or Str modifier piercing damage with one hand. If you make an attack on your turn with the spectral spear, you can make an attack as a bonus action with the blunt end of the spear for 1d4 + your Dex or Str modifier bludgeoning damage. The spectral spear exists until it leaves your hand or you use an action to make it disappear.

## Dragon Bite

_7th-level Dragon Knight feature_

In the spirit of a fierce dragon’s bite, you gain extra proficiency with your weapon. Your spectral spear now counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances, and you gain a +2 to attack rolls with it. Additionally, if you jump while making an attack with your spectral spear, you can deal an extra 1d4 psychic damage with that attack. You may apply this extra damage only once per turn.

## Dragon Sight

_10th-level Dragon Knight feature_

The power of dragons gives you supernatural senses. You can use a bonus action to enable Dragon Sight, which lasts for one minute or until you attack a creature. While active, you can detect magic within a 30 foot radius, and you can see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses on a long rest.

## Dragon Skin

_15th-level Dragon Knight feature_

Dragon skin is tough to pierce, and you have inherited this trait. You can use a bonus action to activate Dragon Skin, which lasts until the start of your next turn. While active, when you’re hit with a spell or attack that would deal damage, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to that type of damage until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses on a long rest.

## Dragon Might

_18th-level Dragon Knight feature_

Dragons are fierce predators, and now, you are too. You can use a bonus action to enable Dragon Might, which lasts until the end of your turn. While Dragon Might is active, the psychic damage you inflict with Dragon Bite is now 1d6 per attack, and you can apply it with every attack. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses on a long rest.
