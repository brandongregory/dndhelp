Many rogues use bows and crossbows, but Snipers use them with deadly accuracy, making shots that are seemingly impossible and scoring devastating hits on unsuspecting foes.

## Master Archer

_3rd-level Sniper feature_

Youâ€™ve gained a mastery of archery that most rogues think impossible. Master Archer weapons include the shortbow, longbow, light crossbow, and heavy crossbow, and you gain proficiency with all of these weapons if you do not already have it. When attacking with a Master Archer weapon, attacking at long range does not impose disadvantage. You also gain the Archery fighting style.

## Death from Above

_9th-level Sniper feature_

Having the high ground gives you a significant strategic advantage. If you are standing at least 10 feet above your target and attack with a Master Archer weapon, a successful sneak attack does extra damage equal to half your rogue level. Additionally, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

## Eagle Eyes

_13th-level Sniper feature_

You have advantage on all Perception checks related to sight. Additionally, if you attack a target with a Master Archer weapon and miss, you have advantage on your next attack against that target with the same weapon.

## Bullseye

_17th-level Sniper feature_

If you attack a creature with a Master Archer weapon, critical hits now deal extra damage equal to your Rogue level. The extra damage is of the same type as your weapon.
