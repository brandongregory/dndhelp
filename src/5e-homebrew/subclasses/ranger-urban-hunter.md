3. Ranger - Urban Hunter

# Urban Hunter

Though trained in the wilds like most rangers, you have adapted your skills to hunt a new kind of prey: city dwellers. Hunting in the city presents unique challenges, and you have a solution for every problem. Urban Hunters often work as bounty hunters, but can also find work in law enforcement or with private patrons.


## Urban Hunter Magic

You learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Urban Hunter Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.

**Urban Hunter Spells**

|Ranger Level|Spell|
|------------|-----|
|3|Disguise Self|
|5|Hold Person|
|9|Dispel Magic|
|13|Greater Invisibility|
|17|Hold Monster|


## Hot on the Trail

_3rd-level Urban Hunter feature_

Starting at 3rd level, you can pick up a scent or some other distinguishing feature of one creature. As a bonus action, you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet of you as the target of this feature. While this creature is marked, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks related to finding it, and you instinctively know what general direction it is in while it is within 100 feet of you. Additionally, the creature’s Wisdom (Perception) rolls to detect you or allies within 30 feet of you are made with disadvantage.

This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. It ends early if you designate a different creature.


## Streetwise Investigator

_3rd-level Urban Hunter feature_

You gain proficiency in the Investigation skill if you don’t already have it, and you can use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Intelligence modifier for Investigation checks.

Additionally, you can attempt to hide when you are in a crowd of 6 or more people.


## Crippling Shot

_7th-level Urban Hunter feature_

When you hit a creature marked with Hot on the Trail using an Attack on your turn, you can force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + wisdom modifier + proficiency bonus). On a failed throw, the creature’s movement speed is halved until the start of your next turn. This feature can be used only once on each of your turns.


## Relentless Hunter

_7th-level Urban Hunter feature_

Once your prey is in your sights, nothing can keep you from it. You have advantage on saving throws against being Blinded or Deafened. Additionally, you have advantage on Athletics checks related to jumping.


## Brutal Familiarity

_11th-level Urban Hunter feature_

You’ve studied your prey and know how it moves and strikes. While a creature is marked with Hot on the Trail, it attacks you with disadvantage, and you have advantage on attack rolls against it.


## City Prowler

_11th-level Urban Hunter feature_

You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Additionally, if you fall 20 feet or less onto a stable surface, you take no damage and land on your feet.


## Marked for Death

_15th-level Urban Hunter feature_

If you hit a creature marked with Hot on the Trail with an attack on your turn, you may make one additional attack against it as part of the attack action on your turn. You may only make one additional attack in this way on each of your turns.


## Dimension Jumper

_15th-level Urban Hunter feature_

You know the fastest way to get to your prey, even if it’s through another dimension. You can cast Dimension Door without expending a spell slot. This spell does not count against the number of Ranger spells you can know. You can do so once per long rest.
