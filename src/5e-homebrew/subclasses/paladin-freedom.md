# Oath of Freedom

The Oath of Freedom compels paladins to fight against tyranny and ensure freedom for the oppressed. This often puts them at odds with established authorities, which can make a straight fight a no-win situation. Paladins of the Oath of Freedom have tactics to stand against multiple foes and protect others who may not be as capable in combat as they are.

**Tenets of Freedom**

The Tenets of Freedom compel paladins to stand against tyranny and protect those who suffer under it.

**Protect the Oppressed.** Before anything else, people facing oppression under tyranny are to be protected. No harm can come to these people through your actions.

**Justice Supersedes the Law.** While paladins of the Oath of Freedom are bound to their oath, they are not bound to the law if that law is unjust. In fact, evil people who operate within the bounds of the law are just the people these paladins are sworn to oppose.

**Support Those Who Uphold Just Laws.** The fight against injustice cannot be won on the battlefield alone. Supporting leaders who will make the laws and the land more just is the way to win the war.

**Teach the Way of Freedom.** The fight against injustice cannot be won by one paladin, however strong. Teach others how to defend themselves so that they may stand against tyranny even when duty calls you elsewhere.


## Oath Spells

_3rd-level Oath of Freedom feature_

|13th|freedom of movement, stoneskin|

## Channel Divinity

_3rd-level Oath of Freedom feature_

You gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.

**Throwdown.** You can use your Channel Divinity to let out an irresistible battle cry to the opponents around you. As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against anybody but you. If opponents are affected by this, you gain a bonus to your armor class equal to your proficiency bonus until the effect wears off.

**Last Stand.** You can use your Channel Divinity to stand strong against multiple enemies. When 2 or more enemies are within 10 feet of you, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a bonus to attack rolls and a bonus to your armor class equal to your proficiency bonus. This effect lasts for 1 minute, but ends early if you end your turn with no enemies within 10 feet of you.


## Aura of Inspiration

_7th-level Oath of Freedom feature_

You exude an aura that inspires nearby allies to fight with all their might. Friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on melee attack rolls made against enemies within 10 feet of you.

At the 18th level, this aura expands to 30 feet.


## Guerilla Tactics

_15th-level Oath of Freedom feature_

The fight against unjust tyrants is not always a straightforward one. You and allies you can see within 10 feet of you have advantage on Stealth checks and can take Hide as a bonus action.

At the 18th level, this distance expands to 30 feet.


## One Against Many

_20th-level Oath of Freedom feature_

You gain the ability to stand against groups of opponents. As an action, you can magically become an valiant defender, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:



* You have resistance to all damage.
* When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make two additional attacks as part of that action as long as those attacks hit different targets.

Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a long rest.
