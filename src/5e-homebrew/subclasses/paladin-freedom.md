The Oath of Freedom compels paladins to fight against tyranny and ensure freedom for the oppressed. This often puts them at odds with established authorities, which can make a straight fight a no-win situation. Paladins of the Oath of Freedom have tactics to stand against multiple foes and protect others who may not be as capable in combat as they are.

**Tenets of Freedom**

The Tenets of Freedom compel paladins to stand against tyranny and protect those who suffer under it.

**Protect the Oppressed.** Before anything else, people facing oppression under tyranny are to be protected. No harm can come to these people through your actions.

**Justice Supersedes the Law.** While paladins of the Oath of Freedom are bound to their oath, they are not bound to the law if that law is unjust. In fact, evil people who operate within the bounds of the law are just the people these paladins are sworn to oppose.

**Support Those Who Uphold Just Laws.** The fight against injustice cannot be won on the battlefield alone. Supporting leaders who will make the laws and the land more just is the way to win the war.

**Teach the Way of Freedom.** The fight against injustice cannot be won by one paladin, however strong. Teach others how to defend themselves so that they may stand against tyranny even when duty calls you elsewhere.

## Oath Spells

_3rd-level Oath of Freedom feature_

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of Freedom Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

**Oath of Freedom Spells**

|Paladin Level|Spell|
|-------------|-----|
|3rd|sanctuary, sleep|
|5th|shatter, warding bond|
|9th|dispel magic, slow|
|13th|freedom of movement, resilient sphere|
|17th|circle of power, destructive wave|

## Channel Divinity

_3rd-level Oath of Freedom feature_

You gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.

**Throwdown.** You can use your Channel Divinity to let out an irresistible battle cry to the opponents around you. As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell DC. On a failed save, a creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against anybody but you for 1 minute.

**Last Stand.** When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your Channel Divinity to make one last stand against your enemy. You make one melee attack against each creature of your choice that is within your reach before falling unconscious.

## Aura of Caution

_7th-level Oath of Freedom feature_

The fight against unjust tyrants is not always a straightforward one. You and allies you can see within 10 feet of you have advantage on Stealth checks.

At the 18th level, this distance expands to 30 feet.

## Deflect Blows

_15th-level Oath of Freedom feature_

When you or a creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus to the target’s AC for that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). If the attack does miss, choose a different creature within 10 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the target of the original attack, using the same attack roll and regardless of the range of that attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## One Against Many

_20th-level Oath of Freedom feature_

You gain the ability to stand against groups of opponents. As an action, you can magically become an valiant defender, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:

* You have resistance to all damage.
* When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make two additional attacks as part of that action as long as those attacks hit different targets.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
