# Way of the Sly Serpent

The Way of the Sly Serpent is a martial art that evolved in cities as practitioners adapted traditional monastic traditions to the more practical requirements of city life. Rather than cloistered warriors with little understanding of the outside world, monks of this tradition were intimately aware of how things worked in cities, which often ran quite contrary to the quiet life most other monks were accustomed to.


## Street Smarts

_3rd-level Way of the Sly Serpent feature_

Years of city living have put you more in tune with your surroundings than the average monk. You can't be surprised while you are conscious. Additionally, you gain proficiency in the Insight skill if you do not already have it, and you gain proficiency in a gaming set of your choice.

## Grapple Master

## Below the Belt

_6th-level Way of the Sly Serpent feature_

While making an attack during the Attack action, you may spend 2 ki points to deliver an unsportsmanlike kick to the groin. If your opponent has testicles, they must make a constitution saving throw. If they fail the save, they suffer major trauma to their testicles and are unable to sire children for the rest of their life. Additionally, their speed drops to 0 until your next turn.


## Retribution

When an opponent within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can spend a ki point to counterattack as a reaction. This counterattack is a regular unarmed attack for you.

As an action, you may spend 2 ki points to gain Truevision out to 30 feet for 1 minute.
