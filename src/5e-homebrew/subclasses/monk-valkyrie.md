Valkyries are highly mobile anti-air units, although they have no problem taking out opponents on land. Whether it’s a flying monstrosity, a dragon, or an airship, when flying enemies attack, Valkyries are often the first to respond. When unsuspecting ground units attack, they can find themselves attacked from above by Valkyries in the air. They typically fight with spears, allowing them to make lightning-fast strikes against opponents who thought themselves safe.

## Leap Attack

_3rd-level Way of the Valkyrie feature_

You learn the signature fighting style of the Valkyries. You gain expertise in the Acrobatics skill. When you use your Step of the Wind feature, your jump distance is tripled until the end of your current turn, and you can calculate jump distance using your Dexterity stat rather than Strength.

Additionally, when you use Step of the Wind and travel at least 10 feet toward an opponent, you may make an unarmed strike as part of your bonus action. If the attack hits, the enemy must make a Strength save against your monk save DC. If the target fails the save, they are knocked prone.

## Fly-By

_6th-level Way of the Valkyrie feature_

When you use your Step of the Wind feature, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can only gain this flying speed a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all uses of this feature on a long rest. If you are in the air at the end of your turn, you fall to the ground.

Additionally, when you are within 5 feet of an enemy at least one size larger than you, you can use your action to make an Acrobatics check contested by either an opponent’s Athletics or Acrobatics check. If you beat the opponent’s roll, you grab on to the opponent and remain affixed to it. When affixed in this way, the opponent can move normally and you have advantage on attack rolls against it. The opponent can use an action on its turn to repeat the Athletics or Acrobatics check to throw you off.

## Valkyrie Weapon Mastery

_11th-level Way of the Valkyrie feature_

The bonus attack you make when using your Step of the Wind feature can now be either unarmed or made with a melee weapon, and you gain a +2 to all attack rolls you make while flying.

Additionally, while you are flying, you do not provoke opportunity attacks.

## Flight of the Valkyrie

_17th-level Way of the Valkyrie feature_

There is no longer any limit to how many times you can gain a flying speed while using Step of the Wind—as long as you have a ki point for Step of the Wind, you can use the flying speed. If you end your turn in the air, you safely descend to the ground at 60 feet per second and take no fall damage when you land.
