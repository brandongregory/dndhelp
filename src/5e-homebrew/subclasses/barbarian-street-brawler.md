Barbarians who walk the Path of the Street Brawler get their training in the streets and use their street smarts and enormous strength to overpower their foes with their bare fists. Instead of growing up in isolated villages, these barbarians often grow up in large cities, getting their early training through mentors with a myriad of backgrounds and usually finding work as hired muscle for dealings in the city, although some make a living as professional boxers.

## Strong Blows

_3rd-level Path of the Street Brawler feature_

Years of training have honed your fists into deadly weapons. Attacks with your fists taken during the Attack action now count as simple weapon attacks and do 1d6 bludgeoning damage plus your Strength modifier. Your attack rolls with your fists are equal to your proficiency bonus plus your Strength modifier. This feature works with a shield.

 At the 14th level, the damage increases to 1d8 plus your Strength modifier.

Additionally, if you're not wearing a shield, you can jab an opponent with your off-hand as a bonus action for 1 plus your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage.

## Street Fighting Fury

_3rd-level Path of the Street Brawler feature_

When you enter your rage, your years of training kick in instinctively and allow you to attack more quickly. Once on each of your turns when you attack with your fists using the Attack action, you can make one additional unarmed attack as part of the same action.

## Cage Fighter

_6th-level Path of the Street Brawler feature_

The raw power in you increases, tapping into crude magic that you can channel through your fists. When raging, unarmed attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

## Crippling Blows

_10th-level Path of the Street Brawler feature_

When you hit a creature with an unarmed attack while raging, you focus on hitting vulnerable places that hinder the creature. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus) or suffer one of the following effects (your choice):

* Be knocked prone
* Have disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn
* Flying speed becomes 0 until the start of your next turn

You can use this feature once per round in combat.

## Brutal Spirit

_14th-level Path of the Street Brawler feature_

Anyone who targets you will pay for it. When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make an unarmed attack against that creature. This attack does 1d8 plus your Strength modifier magic bludgeoning damage.
