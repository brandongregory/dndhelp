Not all artificers are good-natured inventors. Some use their mechanical knowledge to disrupt and destabilize enemy groups and cause as much chaos on the battlefield as possible. Masters of mayhem, Chaos Agents use explosive devices to attack foes, set traps for them, and control the battlefield as their enemies’ tactics fall apart. 

## Tools of the Trade

_3rd-level Chaos Agent feature_

You gain proficiency with Alchemist’s Supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan’s tools of your choice.

## Chaos Agent Spells

_3rd-level Chaos Agent feature_

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Chaos Agent Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

|Artificer Level|Spell|
|---------------|-----|
|3rd			|Grease, Shield|
|5th			|Misty Step, Web|
|9th			|Enemies Abound, Stinking Cloud|
|13th			|Polymorph, Secret Chest|
|17th			|Cloudkill, Mislead|

## Explosive Devices

_3rd-level Chaos Agent feature_

Explosive devices are gadgets you can use in combat to injure or hinder your foes. You gain more options as you gain levels in the class. Each gadget can only be used once. Using an explosive device takes your action. On a long rest, you’re able to rebuild each of your gadgets and regain the use of any you have used. On short rest, you can rebuild one of your explosive devices.

### Sticky Grenade

_3rd-level option_

Target an enemy within 5 feet of you. You attempt to attach the sticky grenade by forcing the target to make a Dexterity save against your spell save DC. If the target fails, the grenade is stuck to them, even if they are able to move or teleport away. If the target passes the save, the grenade falls harmlessly to the floor, although the timer is still running. Whether you attach the grenade or not, you do not provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of your turn.

At the end of your turn, the grenade explodes. The target, along with anyone else within 5 feet of the blast, must make a dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. (If the grenade was successfully attached earlier, that target automatically fails this save.) Targets take 3d6 fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

### Proximity Mine

_3rd-level option_

You plant a proximity mine on the ground where you are standing. Noticing the proximity mine requires an Investigation check equal to your spell save DC. At the end of your turn, the mine arms itself. If you move more than 100 feet away from the device, it will automatically disarm itself and cannot be re-armed.

While the device is armed, any creature that moves within 5 feet of it will trigger its explosion and will have to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. The target takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Stationary objects that are also within 5 feet of the mine when it is activated will also take 3d6 fire damage and may be destroyed.

### Web Bomb

_5th-level option_

You plant a web bomb on the ground where you are standing. (The Chaos Agent defines beforehand where the resulting web will be anchored.) Noticing the web bomb requires an Investigation check equal to your spell save DC. At the end of your turn, the device arms itself. This device will stay armed for up to an hour.

While the device is armed, any creature that steps within 5 feet of it will trigger the effects of the Web spell and must immediately roll as if they had walked into it. The regular rules of Web apply.

### Stink Bomb

_9th-level option_

When you use this device, you set a timer on it (up to 5 minutes). Noticing the web bomb requires an Investigation check equal to your spell save DC. The device will activate when the timer reaches 0, triggering the effects of the  Stinking Cloud spell centered on itself. When this happens, you are immune to the effects of the spell; your allies are not. The regular rules of Stinking Cloud apply.

### Electric Pylon

_15th-level option_

When you use this device, set it on the ground where you’re standing. It will activate at the end of your turn. Once activated, it remains active for 1 minute, crackling with energy and shining bright light in a 15-foot radius.

Any creature that begins its turn in the light or moves into it must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 lightning damage and is stunned until its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and is not stunned.

## Quick Hands

_5th-level Chaos Agent feature_

You can use your bonus action to take the Use an Object action. Additionally, you can now use one of your explosive devices as a bonus action, although you may not use more than one explosive device per turn.

## Efficient Builder

_9th-level Chaos Agent feature_

You’ve learned to build your inventions in less time. You can now rebuild 2 explosive devices when you take a short rest, and you have 2 uses of each of your explosive devices. Additionally, your explosive devices deal an extra 1d6 damage.

## Superior Gadgetry

_15th-level Chaos Agent feature_

Your experience has made your inventions even more deadly. Your explosive devices that deal damage now deal an additional 1d6 damage.

## Jury Rigging

_15th-level Chaos Agent feature_

If you have no remaining uses of one of your explosive devices, you can create one as a bonus action.
